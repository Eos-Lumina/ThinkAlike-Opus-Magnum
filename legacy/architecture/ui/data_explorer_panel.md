# 1. Data Explorer Panel

**Description:**
A customizable UI panel that allows users to visualize and control their data with different visualization options.

**UI Components:**

*   **Data Point List:** Displays categorized data points with tooltips.
    *  **Implementation** Data points are displayed with clear icons to identify source and data type.
    *  **Code Parameters:** Data for each point is validated using UI components that check for format and integrity.
    *    **Testing Instructions:** To validate, create real use scenarios for different data types.
*   **Data Visualization:** Offers different graph templates for data analysis.
    *   **Implementation:** Reusable components for timeline, bar graphs, and circular charts.
     *  **Code Parameters:** Each data point must have a corresponding code implementation to render it correctly using different parameters.
     *    **Testing Instructions:** To test, use a variety of data sets, to validate each parameter and their visual representation.
*   **Privacy Settings:** Actionable options to control visibility, data use and data retention parameters.
   *  **Implementation:** UI components that allow users to choose between different options (public, private, only Al, or specific data points).
   * **Code Parameters:** Use a modular and scalable system for UI options and data access parameters.
  *  **Testing Instructions:**  Test that security protocols work as intended, and also that users have clear feedback about that process.

*   **Data Flow Panel:** A diagram that represents in real-time how user data is being processed, stored, and used, showing API calls, database requests and code implementations.
   *  **Implementation:** Real-time rendering with data validation and error detection.
    *  **Code Parameters:** Use a reusable and scalable code architecture for different types of workflows.
    * **Testing Instructions:** Use several types of data workflows to check for correct performance.
*   **UI Testing Parameters:** Actions for triggering different types of test scenarios with reusable components.
   *   **Implementation:** Customizable parameters for specific test cases that can be modified by users.
  *  **Code Parameters**: Use a modular structure that can be implemented in different workflows.
    *  **Testing Instructions**: To test, follow the recommendations for specific type of testing from code documentation.

**Actionable Parameters:**

*   **Data Origin:** Tooltips display the origin of each data point.
*   **Data Flow:** All workflow implementations are visualized in real-time.
*   **Privacy Impact:** UI provides real-time information about the privacy settings.

**Code Implementation:**
Reusable components are created to enhance implementation cycles. The structure is based on a modular approach where each UI element is independent but also connected to other parts of the code by data flow validation parameters.
