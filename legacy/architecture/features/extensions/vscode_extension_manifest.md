# VS Code Extension for ThinkAlike

This document outlines the plan to create a dedicated VS Code extension for the ThinkAlike platform. This extension will provide a seamless development experience for contributors, integrating ThinkAlike's unique features directly into the editor.

## Core Features

The extension will include the following core features:

*   **Dashboard Panel**: A custom panel in the VS Code sidebar that displays an overview of the ThinkAlike project, including key metrics, project status, and active contributors.
*   **Ritual and Narrative Commands**: VS Code commands to trigger in-editor rituals, advance narratives, and interact with the ThinkAlike platform without leaving the editor.
*   **Provenance Overlays**: Visual cues and annotations that provide context and history for code, documents, and other project artifacts.
*   **Symbolic Navigation**: Enhanced navigation features that allow developers to explore the codebase through symbolic links, archetypes, and narrative threads.
*   **Real-time Collaboration**: Integration with real-time collaboration tools to facilitate pair programming, code reviews, and swarm development sessions.
*   **ThinkAlike Platform Integration**: Seamless integration with the ThinkAlike backend to fetch data, trigger actions, and keep the local workspace in sync with the platform.

## Getting Started

To begin development on the ThinkAlike VS Code extension, we will need to:

1.  **Scaffold a new VS Code extension project**: Create a new TypeScript-based extension project.
2.  **Implement the core features**: Develop the dashboard panel, commands, overlays, and other features outlined above.
3.  **Integrate with the ThinkAlike API**: Connect the extension to the ThinkAlike backend to enable data exchange and platform interactions.
4.  **Test and deploy**: Thoroughly test the extension and deploy it to the Visual Studio Marketplace.
