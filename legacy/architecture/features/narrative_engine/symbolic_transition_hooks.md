# Symbolic Transition Hooks

## Purpose

This file defines how the system transitions users across realms, agents, and symbolic overlays — using narrative cues, timing logic, and ritual synchronization.

These are not hard jumps. They are **symbolic passages**.

---

## Hook Types

- **Threshold Hook** — User crosses a ritual checkpoint (e.g., fork, reveal, reflection)
- **Collapse Hook** — A previous narrative collapses; triggers new arc
- **Mirror Loop Hook** — Swarm contradiction triggers reflective handoff
- **Time Fade Hook** — Agent delay or symbolic silence enters; Kairos-style moment

---

## Hook Outcomes

- Agent switch (with symbolic reason)
- Overlay metamorphosis (tone, icons, delay)
- Dream motif integration
- Ritual memory activation from fork registry

Each transition is encoded as a **symbolic event**, not a system action.
