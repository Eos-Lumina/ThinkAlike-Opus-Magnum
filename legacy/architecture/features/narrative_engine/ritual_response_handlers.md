# Ritual Response Handlers

**Status:** Symbolic Interaction Logic
**Location:** `/docs/narrative_engine/ritual_response_handlers.md`

---

## Purpose

This document defines how ThinkAlike processes ritual inputs from users — symbolic decisions, reflective responses, archetypal challenges — and determines the resulting narrative and structural consequences.

Unlike form inputs, rituals are interpreted semantically, not numerically.

---

## Handler Types

- **Mirror Handler** — Parses reflective choice tone; triggers emotional alignment shift
- **Flame Handler** — Detects decisive symbolic alignment and agent handoff necessity
- **Spiral Handler** — Loops user through evolving paths; rhythm-sensitive
- **Oracle Handler** — Challenges logic path; applies philosophical filters

---

## Response Variables

- Agent modulation (voice, pace, metaphor class)
- Fork registration and future recursion flag
- Narrative score update (symbolic, not gamified)
- Overlay theme resonance feedback

---

## Integration

Handled by the `symbolic_narrative_runtime` during:

- Portal decision trees
- Dream submission interpretations
- Co-creation ritual initiations
- Contradiction mirror loops

---

## Migration Log

- Migrated and harmonized from `archive/zz/ritual_response_handlers.md` and related legacy files.
- Updated to reflect current folder structure and ThinkAlike MVP logic.
- Cross-linked with Eos Lumina onboarding and contributor docs.
