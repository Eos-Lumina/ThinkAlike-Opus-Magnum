# üß† Philosophical Sources of ThinkAlike

ThinkAlike is not built on code alone ‚Äî it is structured by **philosophical gravity**.
This file serves as a curated ledger of thinkers, schools, and systems that shape the symbolic, cognitive, and ethical scaffolding of the platform.

Each reference listed here is not abstract: it appears in the system via:

* Agent voice tone
* Ritual design
* Narrative forks
* Resonance logic

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Notes

* This index informs the symbolic alignment map

* Agents (especially Eos Lumina and Kairos) quote or echo these ideas subtly

**This file is living ‚Äî append and evolve as more thinkers shape future modules.**
