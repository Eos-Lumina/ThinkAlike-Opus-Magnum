# 🌀 Semiotic Story Loops

This document defines symbolic feedback patterns and narrative micro-loops embedded in the ThinkAlike experience.

Unlike traditional “quests” or linear branches, these loops are **recursions of meaning** that allow users to re-encounter previous choices in altered symbolic states.

They mirror:

* Shifts in identity resonance
* Narrative compression of past forks
* Glyphic dream encounters

---

## 🔁 Loop Types

### 1. Reflection Loop

* Trigger: Contradiction fork + journal re-entry
* Action: Agent (Lucia) echoes symbolic artifact from previous choice
* Result: Aura modulation + access to a different narrative variant

### 2. Misalignment Loop

* Trigger: Repeated low-harmonic matches or user drift
* Action: Semiotic overlay suggests forgotten ritual (e.g. mirror glyph)
* Result: Suggests re-entry to an older fork, but with new mythic tone

### 3. Glyphic Resonance Loop

* Trigger: Multiple users dream/share same glyph
* Action: Global UI flare → swarm reflection event
* Result: New symbolic path unlocked (e.g., dream convergence fork)

### 4. Reversible Threshold Loop

* Trigger: Kairos paradox acknowledged but not resolved
* Action: System tracks echo across multiple modules
* Result: Later ritual allows “return to fork” with cost (e.g. aura fracturing)

## 🧠 Purpose

These loops do not reward. They reveal.

* Loops surface the pattern beneath behavior
* They are not “retry” mechanics — they are mythic return
* They create continuity across symbolic timelines

---

## 🔗 System Integration

* Hooks into: `ritual_fork_archive.md`, `resonance_journal.md`, `voice_guided_onboarding.md`
* Controlled via: `archetypal_trigger_events.md`
* Referenced in: narrative agent dialogue, symbolic UI

---

**These loops make the system alive — not just interactive, but responsive to unconscious metaphor.**
