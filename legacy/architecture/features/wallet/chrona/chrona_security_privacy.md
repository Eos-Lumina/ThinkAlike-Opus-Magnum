# Chrona Security & Privacy

## Purpose

Protect users' symbolic memories, ritual expressions, and resonance events from misuse while preserving trust and transparency.

---

## Privacy Modes

| Mode         | Visibility                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| Private      | Only visible to creator              |
| Symbolic     | Visible in metaphor or glyph form    |
| Public       | Fully visible, linkable              |
| Obfuscated   | Glitched or blurred, viewable via glyph only |

---

## Security Principles

- All events are cryptographically signed
- No real names stored unless user provides symbolic alias
- Data access always requires purpose declaration (ritual, reflection, governance)

---

## Tamper Resistance

- Event chain stored with DAG hash integrity
- Any deletion requires multi-party approval (3 symbolic witnesses)
- Memory edits are versioned and logged

---

## Developer Notes

- Do not allow raw text exports without user consent
- All system access must be symbolically mediated
