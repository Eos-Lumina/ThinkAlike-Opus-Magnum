# Chrona User Log Index

## Purpose

Maintains a symbolic and accessible record of each user’s time-bound contributions, reflections, rituals, and identity changes within the Chrona system.

## Structure

Each user log is stored as a chain of symbolic events, cross-linked by archetype and glyph activity. It is the narrative thread of a user's journey through ThinkAlike.

## Example Log Entry

```json
{
  "timestamp": "⧖2025-05-21T03:18Z",
  "type": "glyph_alignment",
  "glyphs": ["The Mask", "The Phoenix", "Water"],
  "context": "Shared with user//mythos-mirror",
  "echo_index": 2
}
```

## Semantic Views

- **Timeline Mode:** A linear, chronological view of a user's events.
- **Constellation Mode:** A visual representation of events clustered by symbolic, thematic, or archetypal relationships.
- **Reflection Mode:** A private view showing only the user's internal or private entries.

## Accessibility

- The log is always fully visible to its owner.
- Entries can be individually marked for anonymized public viewing.
- Reflections can be logged via multiple modalities: spoken word, drawing, or structured ritual participation.

## Developer Notes

- The system should allow users to export their log as a poetic archive or a ritual script.
- A resonance summary should be auto-generated for the user every 30 days, highlighting key patterns and shifts.
