# System Architecture

## Purpose

This directory contains the comprehensive architectural documentation for the ThinkAlike project. It serves as the blueprint for the system's design, detailing everything from high-level overviews and decision records to specific component designs and data models.

## Contents

The architecture is organized into several key subdirectories:

```
.
├── adrs/                     # Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
├── agent_framework/          # Design of the AI agent framework
├── ai/                       # AI-specific architectural patterns
├── api/                      # API design principles and guidelines
├── chrona/                   # Architecture of the Chrona economic system
├── database/                 # Database schemas and data model documentation
├── data_systems/             # Design of data flow and processing systems
├── diagrams/                 # System diagrams (C4, sequence, etc.)
├── narrative_engine/         # Architecture of the narrative and storytelling systems
├── security/                 # Security architecture and protocols
├── swarm/                    # Architecture of the decentralized swarm components
└── ui/                       # UI/UX architecture and component design
```

## Key Documents

-   **[`system_blueprint.md`](./system_blueprint.md):** The highest-level document outlining the project's vision, core principles, and the overall structure of the system. **This is the primary entry point for understanding the architecture.**
-   **[`architecture_overview.md`](./architecture_overview.md):** A detailed narrative overview of the system's architecture, components, and their interactions.
-   **[`technical_stack.md`](./technical_stack.md):** A list of the technologies, frameworks, and platforms used in the project.
-   **[`data_ontology.md`](./data_ontology.md):** Defines the core concepts and relationships that form the project's semantic layer.
-   **[`adrs/`](./adrs/):** Contains all Architectural Decision Records, providing the rationale for significant architectural choices.

## Usage

This documentation is essential for all developers, architects, and system designers working on the ThinkAlike project. It provides the necessary context for building, maintaining, and extending the system in a coherent and consistent manner.

## Dependencies

The architecture described here is the foundation upon which all other project components are built. It is tightly coupled with the philosophical and ethical frameworks outlined in `docs/seed` and `docs/ethics`.
