# Database Architecture

## Purpose
This directory contains documentation related to the ThinkAlike platform's database structure. It provides the canonical reference for understanding the data models that form the foundation of the digital `Commons`.

## Key Documents

- **[`database_schema.md`](./database_schema.md)**: This is the primary document, offering a human-readable overview of the database schema. It includes an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and detailed descriptions of each table and its symbolic purpose within the ecosystem. The schema is derived from the SQLAlchemy models, which are the single source of truth.

## Usage
This documentation is essential for any developer working on the backend, particularly when interacting with data persistence, models, or migrations. It provides the necessary context to understand how data is organized and interconnected.

## Dependencies
- `prisma/schema.prisma` (The implementation of the schema)
- `src/backend/` (The services that interact with the database)
