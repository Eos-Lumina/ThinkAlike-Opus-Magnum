# Symbolic Recognition Rituals

**Status:** Social Confirmation Design
**Location:** `/docs/seed/rituals/symbolic_recognition_rituals.md`

## Overview

Recognition rituals are the symbolic foundation of reputation in ThinkAlike. They enable affirmations, value echoes, and aesthetic forms of acknowledgment without quantized votes or gamified feedback.

## Ritual Examples

- Mirror Echo: recognizing alignment with a symbolic motif
- Ripple Ring: sending symbolic support for a contribution
- Circle Weave: initiating co-authorship via a ritual bond

## Properties

- Each ritual generates a symbolic resonance mark
- Marks decay over time unless reaffirmed
- No numerical scores â€” symbolic density matters

These are the cultural grammar of relational trust.
