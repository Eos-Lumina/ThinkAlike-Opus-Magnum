# Rituals

## Purpose

This directory contains documentation related to the various rituals within the ThinkAlike network. These rituals are structured processes designed to facilitate key transformations, integrations, and interactions within the system's narrative and operational frameworks. They are integral to the user's journey through the three degrees of initiation and interaction with the various realms.

## Contents

```
.
├── dream_integration_rituals.md      # Protocols for integrating insights from the Dream realm.
└── readme.md                         # This file.
```

## Key Files

- `dream_integration_rituals.md`: This document outlines the specific steps and protocols for the Dream Integration Ritual, a core process for users to synthesize and apply knowledge gained from their interactions with the Dream realm and its entities.

## Usage

The documents in this directory are for reference by developers and users who are engaging with the deeper narrative and functional aspects of the ThinkAlike project. They provide the "why" and "how" for the rituals that are implemented in the system's code.

## Dependencies

- The concepts and rituals described here are deeply connected to the `narrative_engine` and the specifications within `docs/realms`, particularly those related to the three-degree initiation structure.

## Notes

The rituals are a key component of the project's "Reflection Loops" and are designed to be enacted both programmatically and through user-driven actions.
