# Dream Integration Rituals

**Status:** Vision-to-System Channel
**Location:** `/docs/seed/rituals/dream_integration_rituals.md`

## Overview

Users may submit dreams, visions, or symbolic intuitions to ThinkAlike via ritual entry. These are not dismissed — they are pattern-mapped and fed into proposal generation, motif matching, and collective ontology updates.

## Submission Format

- Symbolic image or glyph
- Dream segment
- Personal reflection

## Integration Pathways

- Added to `collective_dream_mapping.md`
- Processed by ResonanceAgent for motif clustering
- May become a future narrative path, proposal, or interface gesture

ThinkAlike treats dreams as living epistemic input — not delusion.
