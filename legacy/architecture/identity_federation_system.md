# 🧬 Identity Federation System

The Identity Federation system enables secure, decentralized identity propagation across ThinkAlike modules and environments. It supports **context-aware identity linking** without central databases or surveillance layers.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

- Allow a user’s identity to be reused across modules without duplication
- Enable privacy-preserving profile mapping and trusted attribute reuse
- Prevent fragmentation of trust, reputation, or user history

---

## 🔍 Key Capabilities

- Contextual UUID graph propagation  
- Federated identity proofs via local or modular agents  
- Progressive disclosure architecture (PET overlays supported)  
- Cross-module resonance tracking via shared vectors

---

## 🔐 Security & Consent Model

- Data is signed, not owned  
- Identity linkage requires user-side cryptographic consent  
- Modular encryption scopes allow opt-in network exposure

---

## 🔄 Interoperability

- Fully integrated with `resonance_network_module.md`  
- Interfaces with `onboarding_forking_map.md` for early-stage identity shaping  
- May extend into `wallet_ubi_module.md` for token/account permissions

---

## 🔧 Future Work

- Build a profile aliasing dashboard  
- Define `identity_federation_api.yml`  
- Explore ZK-ID primitives and anonymous attestations

migration_note: Rebuilt from legacy swarm notes and bootstrap thread. Aligned to updated data architecture and modular logic.
