# ðŸ’» Technical Stack & Technologies

## 1. Purpose

This document provides a canonical overview of the core technologies, languages, and platforms that constitute the ThinkAlike technical stack. This stack has been carefully chosen for its scalability, security, alignment with modern development practices, and its capacity to support the project's unique symbolic, ethical, and real-time interactive requirements. It serves as a primary reference for all contributors on the "Build ThinkAlike" path.

## ðŸŸ¢ Core Technologies & Languages

The following technologies represent the primary, harmonized stack for ThinkAlike development:

âœ… **Backend (Orchestration & Logic Layer):**
- **Primary Framework:** FastAPI (Python 3.10+) for high-performance, asynchronous, and clear API services. Pydantic is used for robust data validation and modeling.
- **Supporting Services:** Node.js may be used for specific microservices (e.g., real-time websocket communication) if required.

âœ… **Frontend (Symbolic Interaction Layer):**
- **Primary Framework:** React (or Next.js for SSR/SSG) for dynamic, responsive, and component-based UI.
- **Mobile (Future):** React Native for dedicated mobile apps, maintaining codebase coherence.

âœ… **Databases (Persistence & Memory Layer):**
- **Primary Relational Database:** PostgreSQL for structured data (users, profiles, governance, etc.).
- **In-Memory/Cache:** Redis for caching, session management, and real-time features.
- **Flexible Data:** PostgreSQL JSONB for semi-structured data; MongoDB may be considered for highly unstructured or experimental schemas.

âœ… **AI & ML Platforms (AI & Symbolic Processing Layer):**
- **Primary Libraries:** PyTorch and TensorFlow for custom deep learning models (NLP, symbolic reasoning, resonance calculations).
- **Managed Services:** Google Vertex AI / Hugging Face Transformers for pre-trained models, serving endpoints, and complex ML workflows (e.g., agent personas, AI Personalized Teaching Engine).

âœ… **API Architecture:**
- **Primary:** RESTful API design via FastAPI for clear, structured frontend-backend communication.
- **Future:** GraphQL may be explored for complex, multi-source data fetching (e.g., user profile dashboards).

âœ… **Cloud & Infrastructure:**
- **Primary Providers:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or AWS for scalable, secure hosting, database, and AI/ML services.
- **Version Control:** Git (GitHub canonical repository).
- **Containerization:** Docker and Kubernetes for deployment, scalability, and resilience.

âœ… **Visual & Narrative Design Tools:**
- **UI/UX Design:** Figma or Adobe XD for wireframes, mockups, and prototypes (see canonical_visual_style_guide.md).
- **Architecture & Flow Diagrams:** Mermaid (Markdown-embedded) and PlantUML for clear architectural diagrams.

## ðŸ”® Integration with Symbolic & Conceptual Layers

This technical stack is not just functional; it is explicitly chosen and architected to serve the deeper symbolic layers of ThinkAlike:

- **Symbolic Kernel:** Implemented via the AI & Symbolic Processing Layer, where Python scripts and ML models process symbolic data, calculate resonance (IRS), and power agent behaviors.
- **Chrona (â§–) & The Ledger:** The Persistence & Memory Layer (PostgreSQL) provides the secure, auditable ledger for all Chrona transactions, with the Orchestration & Logic Layer (FastAPI) handling business logic.
- **Swarm Agents:** Agents are modular services/classes within the AI & Orchestration Layers, each with its own logic but communicating via defined APIs, enabling future DGM-style architectures.

## ðŸ”– Final Note

This stack is a living entity, subject to evolution as per the [horizon_scanning_and_ethical_integration_protocol.md](../protocols/horizon_scanning_and_ethical_integration_protocol.md). Every technology choice is weighed against its ability to sustainably and ethically bring ThinkAlikeâ€™s symbolic vision to life, ensuring the "Alchemical Vessel" we build is both potent and sound.
