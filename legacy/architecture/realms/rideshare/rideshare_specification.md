# 🚗 Rideshare Realm Specification – Resonant Mobility & Symbolic Travel

## 1. Vision & Function
The Rideshare Realm enables symbolic travel via aligned resonance. It unlocks through a Hive journey trigger or ritual offer, focusing on trust and shared experience rather than mere transportation.

## 2. Core Principles
- **Geo-Matching by Resonance:** Users are matched for rides based on resonance score, not just location.
- **Archetypal Vehicle Tags:** Vehicles are tagged with archetypes (e.g., “Owl” = silent, “Phoenix” = healer) to guide experience.
- **Gift, Barter, or Chrona:** Exchanges can be non-monetary, using gifts, barter, or Chrona.
- **Shared Story Rituals:** Optional rituals for sharing stories during travel.

## 3. Features
- Resonance-based matching
- Archetypal vehicle selection
- Flexible exchange modes
- Ritualized travel experience

## 4. Mythopoetic Context
> ✳️ “Travel only happens between mirrored souls.”

## 5. Vision for Evolution
Future features may include integration with the Resonance Network, group journeys, and eco-conscious travel options.
