# 💞 Relationships Realm Specification – Resonant Bonding & Symbolic Alignment

## 1. Vision & Function
The Relationships Realm is designed for symbolic alignment and trust-based bonding. It unlocks after a Hive reflection loop or a direct resonance journey, providing a space for deeper, non-transactional connection.

## 2. Core Principles
- **No Swipes, No Profiles:** Connections are made through resonance, not superficial browsing.
- **Mirror Nodes:** Symbolic representation of potential connections.
- **Resonance Rituals:** Tiered questions and symbolic decisions guide the connection process.
- **Progressive Reveal:** Photos, voice, and contact info are only shared after deep narrative alignment.

## 3. Process & Interaction Design
- **Mirror Test:** "Do you remember this face?" – a symbolic test of recognition.
- **Story Offering:** "Offer a story instead of a message."
- **Forked Path Ritual:** "Walk the forked path together before direct connection."

## 4. Mythopoetic Context
> ✳️ “Love is not found. It is *remembered* through resonance.”

## 5. Vision for Evolution
Future iterations may include collaborative rituals, shared story archives, and integration with the Resonance Network and Hives for group bonding experiences.
