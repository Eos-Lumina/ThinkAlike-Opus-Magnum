# Resonance Network Realm Specification (Active Discovery & Resonant Connection)

> **Purpose:** This document provides the detailed, harmonized specification for ThinkAlike's Resonance Network Realm, focusing on active, user-driven discovery of potential connections, the initiation of Narrative Duets to test compatibility, and the formation of consensual, value-aligned relationships. All reveal logic is user-initiated, narrative-driven, and consent-based, in accordance with PET/Clarity and symbolic/ritual standards.

(Refer to the [Source of Truth](../../source_of_truth.md) for overarching principles and context, and [narrative_duet_protocol.md](../portal/narrative_duet_protocol.md) for the mechanics of compatibility testing.)

## 1. Overview & Goals

The Resonance Network Realm is ThinkAlike’s primary space for active, user-driven exploration and discovery of potential connections. Distinct from the Portal Realm—which focuses on guided self-discovery and the system-suggested first match attempt—the Resonance Network empowers users to navigate a living constellation map of User Nodes, each representing a unique individual who has completed their Portal journey.

**Purpose and Distinction:**
- The Resonance Network is where users, now equipped with a fully formed User Node (including their introductory video and initial UserValueProfile), take agency in seeking out new connections. Unlike the Portal’s narrative onboarding where Eos Lumina∴ is the primary guide for connection initiation, here the user is the explorer, making conscious choices about whom to approach.

**Empowerment & Agency:**
- Users are invited to explore a dynamic, visually rich "living constellation map"—sometimes described as a "social neural network." Each User Node is visualized as a luminous point, with connections (lines or pathways) representing the potential or established strength of resonance. With user consent (managed via their profile settings), nodes may be contextually influenced by general geolocation or shared affinities, creating emergent clusters. The map may subtly echo a world map outline or an abstract symbolic landscape, enhancing the sense of a shared, explorable cosmos.

**Core Interaction:**
- The central interaction is user-initiated: users navigate the constellation, identify User Nodes of interest, view their introductory videos and carefully curated abstract profile highlights (like their "Echo Phrase" or Initiation Glyph), and may then choose to **Initiate Narrative Duet** (as defined in [narrative_duet_protocol.md](../portal/narrative_duet_protocol.md)) to test for deeper compatibility. The outcome of this Duet, followed by mutual consent, determines whether a direct connection is established.

**Visual Metaphor:**
- The network is a dynamic, evolving constellation. Connection lines vary in strength and brightness based on underlying resonance potential (calculated from UserValueProfile alignments and enhanced by successful Narrative Duets and ongoing positive interactions). The map is designed to be both symbolically evocative and functionally intuitive, supporting navigation and discovery.

**"Social LLM" & Attunement:**
- The Resonance Network is not static: it “learns” and becomes more attuned over time through "Resonance Feedback & Attunement" mechanisms. User choices to initiate Duets, the outcomes of these Duets, and subsequent (consensual) feedback signals on formed connections help the network’s underlying "Social LLM" to adapt. This refines the visibility of resonant pathways and may highlight emergent communities or patterns of deep resonance (detailed in Section 3 and [resonance_logic_protocol.md](resonance_logic_protocol.md)).

**Outcome:**
- Successful Narrative Duets, followed by explicit mutual consent, result in the formation of direct communication channels and visually stronger connections within the constellation. Unsuccessful Duets are handled gently, with no forced exposure or negative feedback—users simply continue their exploration.

**Underlying Principles:**
- The Resonance Network Realm rigorously upholds PET/Clarity, symbolic/ritual interaction, and the fostering of genuine, value-based connections. User agency, privacy, and transparency are paramount at every stage of exploration and interaction.

**User State upon Entry:**
- Only users who have completed the Portal Realm’s initiation journey (including the creation of their UserValueProfile, introductory video, Initiation Glyph, and Invocation Phrase, and having experienced at least one system-guided Narrative Duet attempt) may enter the Resonance Network. This ensures all participants are prepared for authentic, value-driven connection and have a meaningful, self-defined presence within the constellation.

## 2. User Experience Flow

The user journey within the Resonance Network Realm is one of active exploration, intuitive discovery, and intentional connection.

**Entry into Resonance Network & Initial View:**
- Upon transitioning from the Portal Realm, the user enters the Resonance Network.
- Eos Lumina∴ offers a brief, welcoming voiceover or textual overlay.
- The UI displays the dynamic "constellation map" / "social neural network." User Nodes are visible as luminous points.
- **Resonance Priming:** The system may subtly highlight (e.g., with a gentle glow or brighter connecting lines) a few User Nodes or pathways that have a particularly high qualitative resonance potential with the newly arrived user, based on their UserValueProfile. This is a visual suggestion, not a filter. No IRS percentages or numeric scores are shown to the user at any stage.
- The user can freely zoom, pan, and navigate this space.

**Node Discovery & Initial Glimpse (Hover):**
- As the user navigates, they can hover over any visible User Node.
- Upon hover, a minimal, non-intrusive "Resonance Glimpse" overlay or tooltip appears near the node, displaying:
  - The other user's chosen Name/Pseudonym.
  - Their unique Initiation Glyph.
  - Their short, poetic "Echo Phrase" (crafted during their Portal journey).
  - The visual strength/brightness of the potential resonance pathway connecting to this user (qualitative only, e.g., "High Resonance Potential").
- No video thumbnail, full profile card, age, specific location, or IRS percentage is shown at this hover stage. No numeric resonance scores are ever displayed in the UI.

**Node Selection & Video Viewing (Click):**
- If intrigued, the user clicks/taps on a User Node.
- A focused panel or expanded view elegantly emerges, often connected to the selected node. This panel displays:
  - The selected User Node's (User B's) introductory video, ready to play.
  - User B's Name/Pseudonym.
  - A few key abstract resonant elements (e.g., "Shares your anchor in 'Creative Expression'," or "Also walks the Seeker's Path").
  - A clear Call to Action button: **Initiate Narrative Duet** (or a more evocative phrase like "Weave a Shared Story" or "Explore Resonant Paths").

**Initiating and Engaging in a Narrative Duet:**
- If User A (the exploring user) chooses to proceed after viewing User B's video, they click **Initiate Narrative Duet**.
- The UI transitions to a dedicated, focused Duet space. The constellation map becomes a subtle backdrop or fades.
- Eos Lumina∴ re-emerges to facilitate and narrate this specific Duet.
- The mechanics of the Duet follow the [narrative_duet_protocol.md](../portal/narrative_duet_protocol.md): User A interacts with User B's AI Clone (driven by User B's UserValueProfile and "Resonance Fingerprint"). Choices are made, and the narrative unfolds.

**Outcome of Narrative Duet - Successful Connection:**
- The system, via Eos Lumina∴, determines sufficient alignment based on the narrative choices.
- Eos Lumina∴ informs User A: "The narrative you wove with [User B's Name/Pseudonym]'s Echo found a harmonious conclusion. Their resonant self seems to align with yours. An invitation can now be extended for them to view your heart-light and consider a direct connection."
- User A confirms they wish to send this "invitation to connect" (which implicitly includes sharing their own introductory video and profile elements with User B for this specific purpose).
- User B (asynchronously) receives a notification from Eos Lumina∴: "[User A's Name/Pseudonym], whose heart-light you can now see, found deep resonance with your Echo in a shared narrative. They extend an invitation to complete this bridge and open a path for direct communion. Would you wish to view their heart-light and potentially connect?" User B is then able to view User A's introductory video and relevant profile elements.
- If User B consents (clicks "Accept Connection" or similar), mutual consent is achieved.
- Eos Lumina∴ confirms to both: "The bridge is complete. A path for direct communion is now open."
- A direct communication channel (secure chat/messaging) is enabled between User A and User B.
- **Visual Update on Constellation Map:** The connecting line between User A's and User B's nodes becomes significantly brighter, perhaps takes on a unique "bonded" color, and might have a persistent, gentle pulse indicating an active, direct connection. This positive outcome also serves as a strong signal for the "Social LLM's" Resonance Feedback & Attunement model.

**Outcome of Narrative Duet - Insufficient Alignment:**
- Eos Lumina∴ informs User A of the divergence: "Though you perceived a potential echo in [User B's Name/Pseudonym]'s heart-light, the narrative threads did not fully intertwine in this shared story. This particular resonance was not meant to fully harmonize at this time. Other stars await in the constellation."
- **Visual Feedback:** The focused panel for User B closes. On the main constellation map, User B's node might subtly dim from User A's perspective only for a short period, or the connecting pathway User A was exploring towards it might fade in intensity. This is a temporary visual cue for User A.
- User A is returned to the constellation map interface to continue their exploration.
- User B is NOT notified of this unsuccessful attempt initiated by User A. This respects User B's experience and privacy. This outcome provides a neutral or slightly corrective signal for that specific pairing to the "Social LLM."

**Ongoing Exploration & Network Attunement:**
- The user can continue to explore the Resonance Network, select other User Nodes, and initiate more Narrative Duets.
- The collective outcomes of Duets, alongside consensual "Resonance Affirmations" from successfully connected users, contribute to the network's ongoing learning and refinement. This makes the constellation map and the highlighting of resonant pathways increasingly attuned to genuine compatibility over time. Eos Lumina∴ might occasionally offer subtle, high-level guidance on navigating particularly dense or newly formed clusters of resonance.

## 3. Core Components & Functionality

The Resonance Network Realm relies on several interconnected components to deliver its user-driven discovery and connection experience:

**User Node Discovery UI (Constellation Map):**
- The primary interface for browsing, navigating (zoom/pan), and visualizing the network of User Nodes. Adheres to the Constellation Navigation Schema and Resonance Network Visual Specification.
- Displays User Nodes (Eos-style circle with video thumbnail, Initiation Glyph, Name/Pseudonym, Echo Phrase on hover).
- Visually represents resonance pathways/connections with varying strength/brightness.
- Incorporates "Resonance Priming" for new users.
- Provides the focused panel for video viewing and Duet initiation upon node click.
- Visibility of nodes and their information governed by the Node Visibility Protocol and user privacy settings.

**UserValueProfile & identity_resonance_score.md Integration:**
- The system uses the comprehensive UserValueProfile of all users (built during their Portal journey and potentially enriched by connected services) as the basis for all resonance calculations.
- The [identity_resonance_score.md](identity_resonance_score.md) protocol defines how baseline resonance is calculated between profiles, influencing the "Resonance Priming" and the strength of visible pathways. This score is internal and not directly shown as a pre-Duet percentage.

**AI Narrative Engine & narrative_duet_protocol.md Implementation:**
- This engine, guided by Eos Lumina∴, generates and manages the Narrative Duet CYOA experiences.
- It uses User A's choices and User B's AI Clone (driven by User B's UserValueProfile) to progress the narrative.
- It assesses the alignment based on choices, as defined in [narrative_duet_protocol.md](../portal/narrative_duet_protocol.md).

**Eos Lumina∴ Persona Integration (Resonance Network Context):**
- Ambient Guide: Offers initial welcome and occasional high-level guidance during exploration.
- Duet Facilitator: Actively narrates and facilitates each Narrative Duet, explains outcomes, and manages the consent/reveal process. Her UI (circle/waveform) is prominent during Duets.

**User Interface (Resonance Network Specific):**
- Handles constellation map rendering and navigation.
- Manages node selection, hover states, and the focused video viewing panel.
- Initiates and displays the Narrative Duet interface.
- Implements visual feedback for successful connections (strengthened pathways) and unsuccessful Duets (node dimming for initiator).
- Manages notifications for User B regarding Duet outcomes and connection invitations.

**Direct Communication Module:**
- The secure messaging/chat system enabled between two users upon successful Duet completion and mutual consent. Governed by its own PET/Clarity protocols for communication.

**"Resonance Feedback & Attunement" System (Social LLM Backend):**
- A backend system that processes Duet outcomes and (optional, consensual) post-connection "Resonance Affirmations."
- Adjusts the underlying resonance pathway weights and highlighting logic of the constellation map over time, allowing the network to "learn" and improve its ability to surface meaningful potential connections. This is detailed further in [resonance_logic_protocol.md](resonance_logic_protocol.md).

**Collective Dream Map (Optional Visualization Layer):**
- The Collective Dream Map is an *optional, toggleable visual layer* within the Resonance Network Realm, or may be accessed as a distinct symbolic space linked from the main constellation map. It is not part of the default view for all users and is only visible to those who opt in.
- This map visualizes *emergent collective dream symbols, archetypes, or motifs*—derived from consensually shared and processed dream data as per [`docs/rituals/dream_integration_rituals.md`](../../rituals/dream_integration_rituals.md) and [`collective_dream_mapping.md`](../../seed/symbolic_alignment/collective_dream_mapping.md).
- Dream symbols appear as glowing points, nebulae, or symbolic nodes. The size and intensity of each node represent the frequency or resonance of that symbol within the shared dream pool. Visual narrative threads may connect dream symbols that frequently co-occur or are thematically linked, forming an evolving constellation overlay.
- **User Interaction:** Users can click on a collective dream symbol to view anonymized, aggregated reflections or common interpretations (if such features are developed and ethically managed), or to access related ThinkAlike lore or philosophical concepts. Importantly, this map is *not* a way to browse individual users' dream diaries—the focus is on collective, anonymized patterns and shared symbolic undercurrents.
- **Link to User Nodes (Optional & Consensual):** Users who have opted into dream-based resonance and consented to link specific shared dream symbols to their User Node may see subtle pathways or highlights connecting their node to relevant dream symbols on the map. This creates an additional layer of discovery based on shared profound dream experiences, while upholding privacy and consent.
- **Purpose:** The Collective Dream Map offers a space for understanding shared symbolic undercurrents and collective consciousness, enriching the Resonance Network with a living tapestry of community dreams and motifs.

### 5.1. Underlying Symbolic Dynamics

The effectiveness of discovery and matching within the Resonance Network is influenced by deeper symbolic structures detailed in:
- [Symbolic Attractor Engine](symbolic_attractor_engine.md) (if implemented: guiding how clusters form).
- [Symbolic Ecology Map](symbolic_ecology_map.md) (if implemented: providing layers of meaning to the constellation).
- Principles of [Symbolic Navigation](symbolic_navigation_index.md) (guiding how users might intuitively explore based on symbolic cues rather than just proximity).
- [epistemic_match_modes.md](epistemic_match_modes.md) and [narrative_match_archetypes.md](narrative_match_archetypes.md) (informing the IRS and Duet design).

---

## 6. Success Metrics

**User Engagement:**
- Active navigation and exploration of the constellation map.
- Rate of users clicking on User Nodes to view introductory videos.
- Rate of users initiating Narrative Duets.

**Connection Quality:**
- Completion rate and success rate (leading to mutual consent for direct connection) of Narrative Duets.
- User-reported satisfaction with connections formed (via "Resonance Affirmations" or other feedback).
- Longevity and depth of interactions within formed connections (if ethically measurable with consent).

**Network Health & Attunement:**
- Effectiveness of "Resonance Priming" in guiding users to compatible connections.
- Observable improvement in match relevance over time as the "Social LLM" learns.
- User feedback on the perceived fairness, transparency, and intuitiveness of the discovery and connection process.

## 7. Verification System Integration

- Ensures transparency of how "Resonance Priming" highlights certain nodes (explainable AI principles).
- Validates the ethical design and execution of Narrative Duets (avoiding manipulation, ensuring fairness, clear AI Clone representation).
- Logs Duet initiation, key choices (anonymized if needed for system improvement logs), outcomes, and consent actions for auditability and system refinement (respecting user privacy).
- Tracks the "Ethical Lineage" and performance of the underlying resonance calculation and "Social LLM" attunement models.
- Provides users access to their own data related to Duets and connections via their Data Traceability panel.
