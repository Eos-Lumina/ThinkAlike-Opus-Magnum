# Yggdrasil Resonance Realm Specification – The Living Map of Connection

## 1. Vision
At the heart of the Yggdrasil Resonance Realm lies a profound recognition: we are simultaneously one interconnected whole and many distinct individuals. This duality is not a contradiction but the fundamental pattern of existence itself—a fractal reality where the whole is present in each part, and each part contributes uniquely to the whole.

**The Superorganism Principle:**
Like a mycelial network that connects forests into a single communicating entity, human consciousness forms a superorganism where what affects one affects all. The Yggdrasil visualization embodies this deeper truth: we are not merely separate beings occasionally interacting, but nodes in a living network that thinks, feels, and evolves collectively.

## 2. Core Principles
- **Visualizing the Paradox of Connection:** The visualization must embody unity and diversity, revealing emergent patterns while honoring individual uniqueness.
- **Non-Hierarchical Networks:** Multiple dimensions of connection: Ancestral, Intellectual, Collaborative, Community.
- **Sovereignty Within Connection:** All connections are consensual, contextual, configurable, and revocable.
- **Intergenerational Time Capsule:** The realm supports messages, wisdom, and artifacts for future generations, enabling continuity across time.

## 3. The User Journey
- **Stage 1: Planting Your Root:** User initiates their own node in the Yggdrasil network.
- **Stage 2: Weaving the Branches:** User invites and confirms connections (Ancestral, Intellectual, Collaborative, Community).
- **Stage 3: Sealing a Time Capsule:** User leaves a message or artifact for future generations, with options for scheduled or conditional reveal.
- **Stage 4: Receiving an Echo from the Past:** User receives a time capsule unlocked for them, experiencing intergenerational continuity.

## 4. Key Features & Functionality
- **Non-Hierarchical Graph Visualization:** Reveals both macro-patterns and micro-details of the network.
- **Connection Types:** Ancestral Lineage, Intellectual Lineage, Collaborative Bonds, Community Affiliations.
- **Time Capsule Functionality:** Users can leave messages, schedule/condition reveals, and experience continuity across generations.
- **User Sovereignty:** Granular privacy controls, mutual consent for connections, and revocable links.

## 5. Agent Roles
- **Mnemosyne Archivist∴:** Primary steward, guardian of memory and lineage.
- **Kairos Interscript∴:** Manages temporal logic and unlocking of Time Capsules.
- **Eos Lumina∴:** Guides users through the "Planting Your Root" ritual and initial onboarding.

## 6. Architectural & Component Integration
- **Graph Database:** Required for representing polyvalent, metadata-rich connections.
- **UI Components:**
  - `GraphViewer`: Visualizes the network.
  - `NodeCard`: Displays individual node details.
  - `TimeCapsuleForm`: For creating and configuring time capsules.
- **Decentralized Storage:** Prevents centralized control and supports privacy.
- **Cryptographic Time-Locking:** For secure, scheduled/conditional message delivery.

## 7. PET/Clarity, Ethics & Integrity
- **Consent Model:** All connections require mutual acceptance and explicit definition of context.
- **Privacy Settings:** Users control visibility of their tree and connections.
- **Ethics of Intergenerational Messaging:** Messages must respect privacy, consent, and the dignity of both sender and future recipients. All actions are logged for transparency.

## 8. Unlocking & Access
- The Yggdrasil Resonance Realm is a Third Degree realm, unlocked after core onboarding (Portal) and initial resonance network participation. It is designed for users seeking deeper connection, legacy, and intergenerational impact.

> **See also:** [Canonical Onboarding & Persona Flow](../onboarding_persona_flow.md)
> *The persona, narrative, and symbolic anchors (e.g., Initiation Glyph, Invocation Phrase, UserValueProfile) established during Portal and Resonance Network onboarding are extended and deepened in Yggdrasil, supporting intergenerational connection and legacy.*

**Harmonization Note:**
- This document was harmonized with the canonical onboarding/persona flow and terminology on 2025-06-18. All onboarding, persona, and narrative flow elements are consistent with [../onboarding_persona_flow.md](../onboarding_persona_flow.md). Further updates should maintain this alignment.

## 9. Vision for Evolution
- **Foundation:** Basic graph structure with support for multiple connection types.
- **Enrichment:** Advanced visualization options showing different dimensions of connection.
- **Reflection:** Analytics and insights that reveal patterns without reducing individuals to data points.
- **Federation:** Protocols for interconnecting with other identity and relationship systems.

# Appendix A: Digital Legacy Framework – Family Trees & Posthumous Connections

## Concept Overview
The Digital Legacy Framework extends ThinkAlike's mission of authentic connection across the temporal dimension, creating what we call "timeline transcendence"—the ability for wisdom, stories, and connection to flow beyond physical lifetimes. This feature enables users to:

1. Build interactive family trees with rich metadata
2. Opt-in to personality preservation for posthumous representation
3. Preserve memories, wisdom, and stories for future generations
4. Interact with digital representations of ancestors and historical figures

## Functional Specifications
- **Interactive Family Trees:** Users can create and manage family trees, adding rich metadata to each connection, such as relationship details, historical context, and personal anecdotes.
- **Personality Preservation:** Optional feature that allows users to curate aspects of their personality, preferences, and values to be preserved and presented posthumously.
- **Legacy Content Creation:** Tools for users to create and store messages, videos, and other digital artifacts to be shared with future generations.
- **Ancestral Interaction:** Mechanisms for users to interact with and learn from the digital representations of their ancestors, including guided narratives and contextual information.

## Technical Specifications
- **Data Model:** Extension of the existing graph database schema to support the additional metadata and relationships required for family trees and legacy content.
- **UI Components:**
  - `FamilyTreeViewer`: Visualizes the user's family tree and ancestral connections.
  - `LegacyContentManager`: Interface for creating, editing, and scheduling legacy content.
- **Integration Points:**
  - Connects with the Akashic Record for immutable storage of legacy content and personality data.
  - Works with the Graph Database to visualize and manage complex familial and social relationships.

## Migration Notes
- Migration from existing user story documentation (`docs/unclassified_review/digital_legacy_stories.md`) to the new Digital Legacy Framework structure.
- Users with existing legacy content will have their data mapped to the new schema, with additional metadata fields populated where possible.

*“A human being is a part of the whole called by us 'Universe,' a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.” – Albert Einstein*
