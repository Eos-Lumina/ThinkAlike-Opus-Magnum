# 1. Purpose & Symbolic Role
The Symbolic Text Analysis Engine is not merely a technical parser, but a core system for deciphering the symbolic echoes within user expressions. It illuminates resonant themes and helps attune AI interactions to each user's unique linguistic field. Symbolically, it acts as a "Semantic Oracle"—translating raw text into insights that enrich the UserValueProfile and guide resonant, ethical, and meaningful interactions throughout the ThinkAlike platform.

# 2. Expected Inputs
- `textContent`: String (user-generated text)
- `sourceContext`: Enum (e.g., 'AnchorStatement', 'IntroVideoTranscript', 'DreamOfferingNarrative', 'NarrativeDuetResponse', 'HiveProposalText')
- `userId`: String (for linking to UserValueProfile/Resonance Fingerprint, with consent)
- `languageHint`: String (e.g., 'en', 'es')
- `consentFlags`: Object (explicit user consent for each analysis type and use case, linked to ConsentLog)

# 3. Core Processing Logic & Symbolic Extraction
- **NLP Libraries:** Use spaCy, NLTK, or other approved libraries.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Detect polarity (positive/negative/neutral), intensity, and dominant emotions.
- **Keyword & Key Phrase Extraction:** Identify salient terms and phrases.
- **Symbolic Motif & Archetype Identification:** Map keywords/phrases to entries in symbolic_myth_index.md and narrative_match_archetypes.md. Example: `identified_symbols: [{symbol_id: 'ARCHETYPE_SEEKER', confidence: 0.7}]`
- **Epistemic Mode Indicators:** Analyze style to infer alignment with epistemic_match_modes.md. Example: `epistemic_indicators: [{mode: 'Mythic', confidence: 0.6}]`
- **Interaction Tone Signature:** Classify tone (e.g., poetic, analytical, reflective, urgent, playful) per resonance_fingerprint.md.
- **Ethical Guidelines Enforcement:** Cross-reference with CoreValuesValidator logic, flag ambiguous or potentially harmful language for review, and be cautious with sentiment on ambiguous text. All logic must be auditable and align with ai_model_development_guide.md and ai_bias_detection_guide.md.

# 4. Expected Outputs (Structured JSON)
```json
{
  "trace_id": "uuid_for_this_analysis_event",
  "sourceContext": "AnchorStatement",
  "analysisTimestamp": "iso_datetime",
  "sentiment": {
    "polarity": "positive",
    "intensity": 0.85,
    "dominant_emotion": "hopeful"
  },
  "keywords": ["resonance", "co-creation", "ethical_ai"],
  "key_phrases": ["journey of self-discovery", "building a better future"],
  "identified_symbols": [
    {"symbol_id": "ARCHETYPE_SEEKER", "text_evidence": "my quest for meaning", "confidence": 0.75},
    {"symbol_id": "GLYPH_CONNECTION", "text_evidence": "weave together", "confidence": 0.6}
  ],
  "epistemic_indicators": [
    {"mode": "Mythic", "confidence": 0.65},
    {"mode": "Dialogical", "confidence": 0.3}
  ],
  "interaction_tone_signature": "ReflectiveHopeful",
  "clarity_score": 0.9,
  "ethical_flags": []
}
```

# 5. Integration & Systemic Role
- **UserValueProfile / Resonance Fingerprint:** Outputs directly enrich these profiles.
- **AIClonePersonaEngine:** Provides input for the Clone to understand user style, symbols, and tone for authentic Duet responses.
- **NarrativeEngine:** Tailors narrative prompts and Eos Lumina dialogue.
- **ResonanceEngine (IRS Calculation):** Contributes to symbolic overlap, narrative synchrony, and communicative rhythm.
- **Search & Discovery (Future):** Enables searching for users/content by symbolic themes or keywords (with consent).

# 6. Ethical Considerations
- **Transparency:** Users are informed of analysis and can view symbolic tags, inferred modes, and explanations in their profile.
- **Consent:** Granular consent for each analysis type and use case; all actions logged in ConsentLog.
- **Bias Mitigation:** All models are regularly audited per ai_bias_detection_guide.md for fairness and accuracy across diverse linguistic styles.
- **Privacy & Anonymization:** Outputs used for aggregation are robustly anonymized; raw text is not stored unless essential and with explicit consent.
- **Avoiding Misinterpretation:** Analyses are interpretive aids, not definitive profiles. Users can correct or dispute inferred tags. Agents must treat outputs as probabilistic, not absolute.
- **User Control:** Users can view, request deletion, or opt out of analysis results from their profile.

# 7. Verification System Integration
- All analysis events, outputs, and consent status are logged for auditability. Users can access logs and manage their data via the Data Explorer Panel.

# 8. Security
- All text data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Strict access controls are enforced to prevent unauthorized use.

# 9. Development & Maintenance
- This engine is developed and maintained according to ai_model_development_guide.md, with regular reviews for ethical compliance, transparency, and technical robustness.
