# 🧠 Wisdom Integration Module

The **Wisdom Integration Module** anchors long-range thinking, ancestral insight, and cultural depth within the ThinkAlike ecosystem. It supports reflective, ethical, and human-centered AI behavior.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

To weave sources of enduring wisdom — philosophical, cultural, intergenerational — into the system’s decision-making and user discovery flow.

This module is not about automation. It is about **preserving orientation**, **reclaiming meaning**, and **amplifying signals of long-term value**.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Wisdom Source Registry** — curated list of community-trusted knowledge domains  
- **Elder Circles & Community Insight** — integrate insights from non-digital and oral traditions  
- **Seventh Generation Audit Layer** — time horizon reflection in governance modules  
- **Wisdom Prompts Engine** — subtle nudges in onboarding, forking, and network paths

---

## 📡 Integrations

- `governance_engine_spec.md` → For value-based weighting of choices  
- `resonance_network_module.md` → Match users to archetypal knowledge paths  
- `onboarding_forking_map.md` → Embed reflective or mythopoetic choices in onboarding

---

## ⚖️ Ethics and Sensitivities

- Cultural knowledge sovereignty must be respected  
- Consent-based inclusion of non-Western traditions  
- No data scraping from sacred, undocumented sources  
- Overlay PET (Privacy Enhancing Technologies) where interpretive AI is used

---

## 📌 Future Work

- Build `wisdom_score_model.md` (non-algorithmic trust metric)  
- Launch pilot via Eos Lumina narrative thread  
- Invite contributions from underrepresented knowledge systems
