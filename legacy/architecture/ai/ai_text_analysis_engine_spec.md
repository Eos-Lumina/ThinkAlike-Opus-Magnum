# AI Text Analysis Engine Specification – The Art of Resonant Reading

## 1. Introduction & Symbolic Framing
The AI Text Analysis Engine is not merely a tool for sentiment or keyword extraction. It is a **resonant reader**—a "scribe of the soul"—that, with full user consent, discerns deeper symbolic patterns, archetypal echoes, and epistemic tones from a user's self-expression. Its symbolic role is to translate the Initiate's written word into structured symbolic data for their `Resonance Fingerprint`, enabling more profound connections and self-understanding within the ThinkAlike ecosystem.

## 2. Inputs
- **Anchor Statements**
- **Reflections in response to Eos Lumina's prompts/dilemmas**
- **Introductory Video Transcripts**
- **(Optional, with consent) Dream Offering narrative snippets**
- **(Optional, with consent) Content from Hives or The Noetic Forge**
- All inputs must be accompanied by a `consent_id` from the `ConsentLog` confirming permission for this specific analysis.

## 3. Processing Logic (The Alchemical Distillation)
The engine performs a multi-layered analysis:
- **Layer 1: Semantic Analysis**
  - Extracts keywords and key concepts.
- **Layer 2: Affective & Tonal Analysis**
  - Determines sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and, more importantly, the **Interaction Tone Signature** (e.g., poetic, analytical, questioning) as defined in `resonance_fingerprint.md`.
- **Layer 3: Symbolic & Archetypal Analysis**
  - Identifies metaphors, symbols, and archetypal language by cross-referencing with `symbolic_myth_index.md`.
  - Infers potential archetypes (`narrative_match_archetypes.md`) and epistemic modes (`epistemic_match_modes.md`) from the style and content.

## 4. Outputs (The Distilled Essence)
The output is a structured object ready for integration into the `UserValueProfile`:
```json
{
  "trace_id": "uuid-for-transparency-log",
  "source_text_hash": "sha256-of-the-input-text",
  "analysis_results": {
    "dominant_tone": "Reflective",
    "sentiment": { "score": 0.3, "label": "neutral-positive" },
    "key_concepts": ["resonance", "connection", "transformation"],
    "detected_symbols": ["Loom", "Mirror", "Threshold"],
    "inferred_archetype_signals": { "Seeker": 0.7, "Weaver": 0.4 },
    "inferred_epistemic_signals": { "Mythic": 0.6, "Dialogical": 0.5 }
  }
}
```

## 5. Integration
- Raw text from various realm services is sent to this engine.
- The structured JSON output is used by the **`UserValueProfile` Service** to update a user's "Resonance Fingerprint."
- All operations are logged via the `ai_transparency_log_guide.md`.

## 6. Ethical Considerations (Crucial Section)
- **Consent is Paramount:** No text is analyzed without specific, granular, and revocable user consent. The purpose of the analysis (e.g., "to refine your Resonance Fingerprint for better matching") must be stated clearly at the point of consent.
- **Non-Surveillance:** This engine is a tool for user-empowering self-reflection and profile enrichment, not a surveillance mechanism. It analyzes text submitted in specific, consensual contexts only.
- **Avoiding Definitive Labels:** The engine generates *signals* or *inferences* (e.g., "signals of Seeker archetype"), not definitive psychological labels. The UI must always frame this data as a "reflection" or "potential resonance," not a "diagnosis."
- **Bias Mitigation:** All NLP models must be rigorously tested for bias as per the `ai_bias_detection_guide.md`.

## 7. Security, Privacy, and Transparency
- All text data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- Strict access controls are enforced.
- All analysis events and results are logged for transparency and auditability.
- Users can view and delete their analysis results via the Data Explorer Panel.

## 8. References & Crosslinks

## 9. Technical Implementation Notes

-   **Core Libraries:** The engine will primarily be built in Python, leveraging established Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries such as **spaCy** and **NLTK** for foundational tasks like tokenization, sentiment analysis, and keyword extraction.
-   **Symbolic Mapping:** The "Symbolic & Archetypal Analysis" layer will require custom logic to map extracted keywords and concepts to the project's `symbolic_myth_index.md`. This involves creating and maintaining a robust dictionary or a fine-tuned classification model.
-   **Service Architecture:** This engine should be implemented as a modular, containerized microservice that can be called by other backend services (e.g., the UserValueProfile Service) via a well-defined API. This ensures scalability and separation of concerns.

This specification supersedes the legacy `ai_text_analysis_engine.md` and is the canonical reference for all future development and harmonization efforts.
