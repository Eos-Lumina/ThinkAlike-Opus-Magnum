# AI Clone Persona Engine Specification (Canonical)

## 1. Purpose
The AI Clone Persona Engine generates dynamic, persona-consistent responses and choices for a user's AI Clone within a Narrative Duet. It draws from the user's UserValueProfile, Resonance Fingerprint, and other symbolic/epistemic data to ensure the Clone acts in character, supporting authentic, meaningful, and ethical interactions.

## 2. Inputs
- **UserValueProfile:**
  - Core values, archetypes, epistemic match modes, anchor statement, narrative themes (from video/dream offerings if consented).
- **Resonance Fingerprint:**
  - Symbolic/semantic profile, identity resonance score, narrative match archetypes.
- **Current Narrative Duet Context:**
  - Current narrative branch, user’s last choice, system prompts, active ritual phase.
- **Consent & PET/Clarity Flags:**
  - User consent status, privacy/ethics/transparency requirements.

## 3. Processing Logic (Conceptual)
- **Persona Synthesis:**
  - Weighs UserValueProfile and Resonance Fingerprint to generate a persona profile for the AI Clone.
  - Prioritizes values, archetypes, and epistemic modes most relevant to the current narrative context.
- **Choice/Response Generation:**
  - Generates choices or narrative responses that are consistent with the synthesized persona.
  - Uses narrative_duet_protocol.md to ensure responses fit the current story branch and ritual phase.
  - Aims for "constructive complementarity"—the Clone should support, challenge, or harmonize with the user in ways that foster growth and resonance.
- **Persona Consistency:**
  - Maintains a consistent "voice" and decision pattern across the Duet, referencing anchor statements and symbolic themes.
  - Handles ambiguity or contradictions in the user’s profile by defaulting to PET/Clarity and symbolic alignment.
- **Ethical Guardrails:**
  - Prevents generation of harmful, manipulative, or misrepresentative content.
  - Enforces PET/Clarity: respects user consent, privacy, and transparency at all times.
  - Surfaces ambiguous or ethically complex choices to the user for confirmation.

## 4. Outputs
- **Clone’s Choice:**
  - The AI Clone’s selected choice in the Narrative Duet (CYOA format).
- **Narrative Response:**
  - A short textual or symbolic response, optionally narrated by Eos Lumina∴.
- **Persona Trace Log:**
  - Metadata on which aspects of the UserValueProfile and Resonance Fingerprint influenced the choice (for transparency and debugging).

## 5. Integration Points
- **narrative_duet_protocol.md:**
  - Ensures all choices and responses are valid within the current narrative structure.
- **resonance_logic_protocol.md:**
  - Uses resonance logic to adjust persona synthesis and response weighting.
- **identity_resonance_score.md, resonance_fingerprint.md:**
  - Draws on these for symbolic/semantic alignment.
- **ai_transparency_log_guide.md:**
  - Logs all persona synthesis and choice generation steps for auditability.

## 6. Ethical & Symbolic Alignment
- **PET/Clarity Compliance:**
  - All processing and outputs must comply with PET/Clarity standards.
- **Symbolic/Ritual UX:**
  - The Clone’s behavior should reinforce the symbolic/ritual intent of the Narrative Duet, supporting the "Ritual over Interface" philosophy.
- **User Agency:**
  - Users can review, override, or adjust their Clone’s persona and choices at any time.

## 8. Technical Implementation Notes

-   **Modular Sub-Components:** The engine's "Persona Synthesis" logic can be conceptually broken down into several sub-processors, as sketched in legacy architecture documents:
    -   A **ValueAnalyzer** to parse and weigh the `UserValueProfile`.
    -   An **EmotionalAnalyzer** (or TonalAnalyzer) to interpret the "Interaction Tone Signature".
    -   A **NarrativeContextProcessor** to understand the current state of the Duet.
-   **Service Architecture:** This engine should be a dedicated microservice that exposes an endpoint for generating a Clone's choice/response based on a given user ID and narrative context.
-   **State Management:** The engine itself is stateless. It retrieves the necessary user and narrative data for each request, ensuring consistency and scalability.
