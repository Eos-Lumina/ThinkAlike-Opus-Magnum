# 1. Purpose & Symbolic Role
This engine's **sole purpose** is to analyze the audio track from a user's consensually provided Introductory Video to extract a limited set of vocal characteristics. These parameters are used exclusively to inform a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system, allowing the user's AI Clone to utter narrative-specific phrases during a Narrative Duet, and for Eos Lumina∴ to present AI-reworked voice snippets as abstract clues in the "Whispering Gallery," with vocal qualities that *evoke* the user's style (e.g., general pitch, cadence).

**Crucially, this engine DOES NOT perform speech-to-text for semantic analysis, transcribe content, identify speakers, or detect emotions.** Its focus is strictly on non-semantic, measurable vocal features relevant for basic voice parameterization for TTS.

**Symbolic Role:** It contributes to the "vocal aura" or "resonant echo" of the AI Clone and abstract clues, enhancing the sense of a personalized (yet still representational) interaction, without attempting to create a perfect vocal mimicry. It's about an *evocative hint*, not a deepfake.

# 2. Expected Inputs
- `processedAudioStream`: Audio data from the user's **Introductory Video** (created in Portal Phase 5.3).
- `userId`: For associating parameters.
- `consentFlags`: Object, confirming explicit, granular user consent for *this specific type of voice parameter extraction* for *this specific, limited purpose* (AI Clone TTS & abstract clues). Must be logged in `ConsentLog`.

# 3. Core Processing Logic (Vocal Feature Extraction)
- [Details TBD: Reference specific audio processing libraries like Librosa, Praat, or specialized, ethically vetted models for feature extraction only].
- Extracts features such as:
  - Fundamental Frequency (Pitch) average and range.
  - Speech Rate / Cadence (e.g., syllables/words per second).
  - (Potentially) Basic spectral features related to timbre (e.g., brightness, roughness – use with extreme caution and robust bias testing, focusing on general voice quality rather than unique identifiers).
- **Strictly Avoids:** Emotion detection, semantic content analysis, linguistic analysis, speaker identification beyond parameter generation for the *known* user.
- Maps extracted features to a standardized set of parameters usable by a target TTS system (e.g., parameters for a generic voice model that can be inflected by these features).

# 4. Expected Outputs (Structured JSON for TTS Parameterization)
```json
{
  "trace_id": "uuid_for_this_analysis_event",
  "analysisTimestamp": "iso_datetime",
  "voice_parameters": {
    "pitch_base_hz": 185.0,
    "pitch_range_percentage_variation": 30.0,
    "speech_rate_wpm": 150,
    "speaking_volume_avg_db": -12.0,
    "timbre_profile_ref": "general_human_resonant_v1_style_A"
  },
  "confidence_score_for_parameters": 0.85
}
```
This output is stored securely, associated with the user's AI Clone configuration.

# 5. Integration & Systemic Role
- **Called By:** Backend pipeline triggered after Introductory Video processing and explicit consent check (likely managed by `PortalRealmService` or `UserProfileService`).
- **Writes To:** Secure storage linked to `UserValueProfile` or AI Clone data (e.g., `UserValueProfile.aiCloneVoiceParameters`).
- **Provides Data To:**
  - `AIClonePersonaEngine`: Passes these parameters (with generated text) to a TTS engine to synthesize the AI Clone's "voice" during Narrative Duets.
  - Eos Lumina∴ (via Narrative Engine): For generating AI-reworked abstract voice snippets in the "Whispering Gallery."
- **Verification System & `AI Transparency Log`:** Logs analysis events, parameter generation, and consent status. Users can see *that* voice parameterization occurred and for what purpose.

# 6. Ethical Considerations
- **Consent is Paramount:** Requires separate, explicit, opt-in consent for voice parameter extraction for *this specific, limited purpose*. Clearly explain to users what it is and what it is *not* (not full voice cloning, not speech-to-text).
- **Strict Purpose Limitation:** Generated parameters *only* for AI Clone TTS in Duets and abstract voice clues. No other use.
- **Transparency:** Users are informed this analysis happens *if they consent*. They can view the *fact* that parameters were generated (and perhaps high-level descriptors, not the raw parameters themselves if they are not human-meaningful) and can request deletion of these parameters via their Data Explorer Panel / Profile Settings. The *use* of these parameters in Duets/clues is logged in the `AI Transparency Log`.
- **Avoid Deepfakes – Evocative Echo, Not Mimicry:** The goal is **characteristic similarity in general vocal style (pitch, cadence) to enhance the AI Clone's symbolic presence, not to create a perfect or indistinguishable vocal replica.** Emphasize use of feature extraction to *parameterize general TTS models*, not full voice cloning from short samples unless technology and ethics mature significantly and with further explicit consent for such.
- **Bias Mitigation:** Audio analysis models can have biases (e.g., based on gender, accent, microphone quality). Rigorous testing of the feature extraction models against diverse voice samples is required as per `ai_bias_detection_guide.md`. The system should aim for equitable quality of parameter extraction.
- **Security:** Voice parameters are sensitive. Store securely with strong encryption and access controls.
- **User Control & Deletion:** Users can revoke consent, and upon revocation, generated voice parameters must be deleted.

# 7. Development & Maintenance
- This engine will be developed and maintained according to the `ai_model_development_guide.md`.
