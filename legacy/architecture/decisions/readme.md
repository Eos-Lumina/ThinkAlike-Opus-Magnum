# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a short, immutable document that captures a significant architectural decision made during the evolution of the ThinkAlike project. Each ADR describes the context of the decision, the decision itself, and the consequences of that decision. The collection of ADRs provides a historical log of our architectural journey.

## Why do we use ADRs?

- **Transparency:** They make the reasoning behind our architecture public and clear.
- **Onboarding:** New contributors can read through the ADRs to understand how and why the system is built the way it is.
- **Asynchronous Collaboration:** They allow for better asynchronous decision-making, as the context and reasoning are fully documented.
- **Accountability & Auditability:** They provide a clear audit trail of our architectural choices, aligning with the project's core ethos.

## The Process

1.  **Identify a Decision:** When a significant architectural decision needs to be made, any contributor can propose an ADR.
2.  **Use the Template:** Copy `0000_template.md` to a new file named `NNNN-short-title-of-decision.md`, where `NNNN` is the next sequential number.
3.  **Fill out the ADR:** Complete the fields in the template. The initial status should be "Proposed."
4.  **Discuss:** Submit the ADR as a pull request. The decision will be discussed and debated in the PR comments.
5.  **Approve & Merge:** Once consensus is reached (following the project's governance model), the ADR will be approved. The status will be changed to "Accepted," and the PR will be merged. The ADR is now immutable.

An ADR can be superseded by a later ADR, but it should never be deleted or modified after being accepted.
