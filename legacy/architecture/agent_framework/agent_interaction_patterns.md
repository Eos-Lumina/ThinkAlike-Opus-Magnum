# Agent Interaction Patterns (Topologies)

Inspired by research in multi-agent system (MAS) design, particularly the findings in "Multi-Agent Design: Optimizing Agents with Better Prompts and Topologies" (Zhou et al., 2025), this document outlines key interaction patterns that can be implemented within the ThinkAlike agent framework. These patterns describe how multiple agents can collaborate or interact to solve complex tasks more effectively.

The core idea is that well-defined individual agents (optimized at the "block-level" with strong personas and capabilities) can be orchestrated using these patterns to achieve superior results.

## Key Interaction Patterns

### 1. Aggregate

*   **Description:** Multiple agents (potentially of the same or different types) work on the same task or sub-task in parallel. Their individual outputs are then collected and aggregated by a designated agent or mechanism to produce a single, often more robust or comprehensive, result.
*   **Aggregation Mechanisms:**
    *   **Voting:** For classification or decision-making tasks.
    *   **Averaging/Merging:** For numerical or content-generation tasks.
    *   **Summarization:** A dedicated agent summarizes diverse outputs.
    *   **Best-Selection:** An evaluator agent picks the best output based on certain criteria.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Improving accuracy by reducing individual agent errors.
    *   Generating diverse perspectives or solutions to a problem.
    *   Brainstorming and idea generation.
*   **ThinkAlike Implementation:**
    *   The orchestrator (`EosLuminaAgent` or a dedicated sub-orchestrator) could dispatch a task to several relevant sub-agents.
    *   An "aggregator" sub-agent type could be developed, or the orchestrator itself could perform simple aggregation.

### 2. Reflect (Critique & Refine)

*   **Description:** An agent produces an initial output. This output is then reviewed and critiqued, either by the original agent itself (self-reflection) or by one or more specialized "critic" or "reviewer" agents. Based on the feedback, the output is refined, potentially through multiple iterations.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Improving the quality, accuracy, or coherence of generated text or code.
    *   Fact-checking and error correction.
    *   Ensuring outputs align with specific constraints or guidelines.
    *   Iterative problem-solving.
*   **ThinkAlike Implementation:**
    *   A "generator" agent produces content.
    *   A "critic" agent (with a persona focused on evaluation, specific knowledge domains, or ethical guidelines) reviews it.
    *   The orchestrator manages the feedback loop between the generator and critic.

### 3. Debate

*   **Description:** Two or more agents take on different (often opposing) roles, perspectives, or hypotheses concerning a topic or problem. They engage in a structured discussion, presenting arguments, counter-arguments, and evidence. The goal is to explore the problem space thoroughly, uncover hidden assumptions, or arrive at a more nuanced or well-supported conclusion.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Complex decision-making.
    *   Exploring ethical dilemmas.
    *   Stress-testing proposals or solutions.
    *   Generating arguments for and against a position.
*   **ThinkAlike Implementation:**
    *   The orchestrator assigns roles/stances (derived from personas or task requirements) to participating sub-agents.
    *   A protocol for turn-taking and argument presentation would be needed.
    *   A "moderator" or "synthesizer" agent might be used to summarize the debate or extract key conclusions.

### 4. Tool-Use

*   **Description:** Agents are equipped with the ability to use external tools, APIs, or data sources to gather information, perform calculations, execute code, or interact with other systems. This extends their capabilities beyond their inherent LLM knowledge.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by accessing vector databases or search engines.
    *   Executing code (e.g., Python scripts for data analysis).
    *   Accessing real-time information (e.g., weather, stock prices).
    *   Interacting with external services (e.g., booking systems, knowledge bases).
*   **ThinkAlike Implementation:**
    *   `BaseAgent` could provide a standardized interface for tool definition and execution.
    *   The orchestrator or the agent itself decides when and how to use a tool based on the task and its persona.
    *   Security and resource management for tool use are critical considerations.

### 5. Sequential Pipeline (Chaining)

*   **Description:** Agents are arranged in a sequence, where the output of one agent becomes the input for the next. Each agent in the chain performs a specific transformation or adds value to the data.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Multi-step data processing (e.g., extract -> transform -> analyze).
    *   Complex task decomposition where each step is handled by a specialist agent.
    *   Generating complex artifacts by building them up incrementally.
*   **ThinkAlike Implementation:**
    *   The orchestrator defines the sequence and routes data between agents.
    *   This is a fundamental pattern that can be combined with others (e.g., a step in a pipeline could involve an "Aggregate" pattern).

### 6. Custom & Specialized Agents (including Summarize)

*   **Description:** While the above are general patterns, specific tasks may benefit from highly specialized agents. A "Summarize" agent is a common example, crucial for condensing information from long documents, chat histories, or outputs from other verbose agents.
*   **Use Cases (Summarize):**
    *   Reducing information overload.
    *   Extracting key insights.
    *   Preparing context for other agents or for human review.
*   **ThinkAlike Implementation:**
    *   Develop specific sub-agent types with personas and capabilities tailored to niche tasks.
    *   A `SummarizationAgent` would be a high-priority specialized agent.

## Applying These Patterns

The choice of interaction pattern will depend on the nature of the task, the desired outcome, and the available agent capabilities. The `EosLuminaAgent` (or a dedicated orchestration layer) will be responsible for:

1.  **Task Decomposition:** Breaking down complex requests into sub-tasks suitable for individual agents or specific interaction patterns.
2.  **Agent Selection:** Identifying and allocating appropriate sub-agents from the `AgentRegistry`.
3.  **Pattern Invocation:** Initiating and managing the chosen interaction pattern (e.g., setting up a debate, managing a reflect loop, aggregating results).
4.  **Prompt/Persona Adaptation (Future):** Potentially providing context or slight modifications to agent prompts/personas based on their role within a specific pattern and workflow, as suggested by the "workflow-level prompt optimization" stage in the Mass paper.

By consciously designing with these patterns in mind, we can create a more robust, flexible, and powerful multi-agent system in ThinkAlike.
