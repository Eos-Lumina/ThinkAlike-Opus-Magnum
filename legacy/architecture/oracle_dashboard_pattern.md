Symbolic, Transparent, and Ritualized Dashboards for Decision-Making in ThinkAlike

## Purpose
The Oracle Dashboard Pattern defines a symbolic and interactive dashboard architecture for ThinkAlike, enabling transparent, auditable, and ritualized decision-making. It harmonizes legacy dashboard logic with the current Realms, Agents, and Ritual UX standards.

## Guiding Principles
- **Symbolic UX:** Dashboards are not just data displaysâ€”they are ritual spaces for insight, reflection, and swarm guidance.
- **Transparency:** All dashboard actions and visualizations are logged and auditable.
- **Swarm Invocation:** Dashboards can be activated by agents (e.g., Eos Lumina) or user rituals, supporting emergent, collective intelligence.
- **Modularity:** Each dashboard is composed of reusable, pluggable components (widgets, oracles, traceability overlays).

## Core Architecture
- **Event-Driven Updates:** Dashboards subscribe to real-time event streams (user actions, agent signals, system state changes).
- **Validation & Feedback:** Visual cues and symbolic widgets provide immediate feedback, reinforce trust, and validate user actions.
- **Ritual Invocation:** Dashboards can be invoked with symbolic phrases or gestures, aligning with the Oracle agent's ritual functions.

## Example Use Cases
- Swarm decision rituals (e.g., "Look through the veil")
- Real-time audit and validation overlays
- Emergent fork visualization and transition tracking
- Agent-guided onboarding or review ceremonies

## Integration Points
- **Oracle Agent:** Symbolic agent for dashboard invocation and ritual logic.
- **Hermes Workflow Conductor:** Orchestrates dashboard-driven workflows.
- **DataTraceability:** All dashboard actions are logged for audit and review.
