# Dashboard & Visualization Logic

> **Note for non-developers and new contributors:**
> This file documents technical logic for dashboard visualizations. Most users do not need to reference or edit this file. For onboarding and project overview, see the [Quickstart for Non-Developers](../../QUICKSTART_FOR_NONDEVELOPERS.md).

This document defines the architecture, design patterns, and integration strategies for dashboards and data visualization within the ThinkAlike platform. It synthesizes legacy insights (notably from `obsidian_dashboard_logic.md`) with current symbolic and modular UI principles.

## 1. Introduction
Dashboards in ThinkAlike are not just data displays—they are interactive, symbolic interfaces that provide real-time feedback, validate user actions, and reinforce system transparency. The architecture is designed for modularity, extensibility, and alignment with the platform’s core principles: Radical Transparency, User Sovereignty, and Symbolic UX.

## 2. Legacy Insights
Legacy documentation (see: [obsidian_dashboard_logic.md](../filtered_legacy/batch6/obsidian_dashboard_logic.md)) contributed:
- Widget/component orchestration for real-time dashboards
- Obsidian-based scripting patterns for modular visualization
- Event-driven updates and user feedback loops
- Recommendations for integrating symbolic UI elements and data traceability overlays

## 3. Core Patterns & Architecture
- **Real-Time Data Feedback:** Dashboards subscribe to event streams (e.g., user actions, system state changes) and update visualizations instantly.
- **UI as Validation Tool:** Visual cues and symbolic widgets (e.g., audit trails, consent indicators) provide immediate feedback and reinforce trust.
- **Modular Components:** Each dashboard element is a reusable, pluggable component, supporting rapid evolution and customization.

## 4. Integration & Next Steps
- Integrate symbolic UI elements and data traceability overlays into all dashboards.
- Ensure all new dashboard modules follow the modular, event-driven architecture.
- Reference and adapt legacy scripting patterns as needed for advanced visualization needs.
