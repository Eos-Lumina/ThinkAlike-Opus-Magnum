# ThinkAlike System Architecture Overview

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the ThinkAlike system architecture, illustrating the primary layers, core services, and data flow between them.

        B1["PET/Clarity (Public Interface)"]
        B3["Governance Realm (DAO Interface)"]

    %% --- High-Level Connections ---

    %% User-facing interfaces talk to the central gateway
    B1 --> S2
    B3 --> S2
    B4 --> S2

    %% The Gateway routes to application services
    S2 --> C
    S2 --> D
    S2 --> E
    S2 --> S3

    %% Application services consult the ethical AI
    C -- "consults" --> S1
    D -- "consults" --> S1
    E -- "consults" --> S1

    %% Application services interact with each other
    C <--> E

    %% Application services use the data layer
    C --> F1
    C --> F2
    D --> F3
    D --> F1
    E --> F2
    E --> F4
```
