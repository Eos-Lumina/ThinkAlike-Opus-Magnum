Orchestrating Transparent, Ethical, and Symbolic Workflows Across Realms

## Purpose
Hermes is the orchestration engine for complex, multi-step processes across ThinkAlike Realms and services. It ensures workflows are transparent, auditable, and aligned with User Sovereignty, Radical Transparency, and Ethical AI principles.

## Guiding Principles
- **Transparency:** All workflow steps are logged and visible via DataTraceability.
- **User Agency:** Users can view, pause, or intervene in workflows where appropriate.
- **Ethical AI:** All AI-driven steps are subject to bias checks, explainability, and ethical review.
- **Symbolic/Narrative UX:** Workflows can be ritualized or narrated for deeper engagement.

## High-Level Architecture
- **Interfaces:** Hermes connects with Agents (e.g., Eos Lumina), Realms, DataTraceability, and the Verification System.
- **Core Functionality:**
  - Workflow definition (YAML/JSON or UI)
  - Execution and monitoring
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Conditional logic and branching

## Example Workflows
- Advanced onboarding sequences
- Multi-stage artifact submission/review
- Complex user queries requiring agent coordination

## Interactions
- **Eos Lumina:** Can trigger or narrate Hermes workflows, providing symbolic guidance.
- **HASI:** Human-Artificial Swarm Intelligence manifests in collaborative, adaptive workflows.
