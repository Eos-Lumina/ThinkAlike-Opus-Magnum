# ðŸªž Reflection Loops Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains the foundational protocols and logs for ThinkAlike's systemic self-reflection and integrity processes. It defines the mechanisms by which the ecosystem detects, flags, and resolves internal contradictions, semantic drifts, or ethical misalignments.

These loops are not for punishing errors, but for ritualizing incoherence into a sacred opportunity for clarification, growth, and realignment. This is the project's immune system and contemplative conscience.

## Key Documents

- **[contradiction_flagging_protocol.md](./contradiction_flagging_protocol.md):** Outlines the protocol for agents and users to detect and flag symbolic or ethical contradictions without censorship, initiating a resolution ritual.

- **[mirror_event_registry.md](./mirror_event_registry.md):** The active log where all "Mirror Events"â€”moments of systemic divergence or incoherenceâ€”are recorded for review and resolution.

- **[symbolic_alignment_review_log.md](./symbolic_alignment_review_log.md):** The audit trail capturing the results of scheduled and triggered reviews of the project's overall symbolic, semantic, and ritualistic coherence.
