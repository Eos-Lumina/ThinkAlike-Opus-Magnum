# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the ThinkAlike project. ADRs document important architectural decisions, their context, and consequences.

## ADR Format

Each ADR should follow a consistent format, typically including:

- **Title:** A short, descriptive title for the decision.
- **Status:** (e.g., Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
- **Date:** The date the ADR was last updated.
- **Context:** The problem or issue that this decision addresses.
- **Decision:** The chosen solution or approach.
- **Consequences:** The positive and negative consequences of this decision.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Other options that were evaluated.
- **References:** Links to relevant documents or discussions.

A template (`adr_template.md`) is provided in this directory.
