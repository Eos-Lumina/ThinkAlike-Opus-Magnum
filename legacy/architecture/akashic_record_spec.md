# Akashic Record: Technical Specification

## 1. Introduction

The Akashic Record is a decentralized, immutable, and permanent storage system for knowledge, memory, and provenance data within the ThinkAlike network. It serves as the long-term memory for all agents and the system as a whole, ensuring data integrity, verifiability, and resistance to censorship.

This document provides the technical specification for the Akashic Record.

## 2. System Architecture

*   **Storage Layer:** [Details on the underlying storage technology, e.g., IPFS, Arweave, a custom blockchain solution]
*   **Data Model:** [Details on the data structures, content addressing, and cryptographic verification]
*   **Access Control:** [Details on how agents and users interact with the record, including read/write permissions]
*   **API Endpoints:** [Initial OpenAPI/gRPC specification]

## 3. Provenance & Verifiability

[Details on how data provenance is tracked and how the integrity of the record can be independently verified.]

## 4. Integration with Core Systems

[Details on how the Akashic Record integrates with the Living Narrative Engine, Agent Swarms, and other core components.]

## 5. Roadmap

*   **Phase 1: Prototype Development**
*   **Phase 2: Integration & Testing**
*   **Phase 3: Network-Wide Deployment**
