# üåê Trust Network Topology

## üß≠ Purpose

This document maps the symbolic, technical, and relational structure of trust within ThinkAlike‚Äôs collective intelligence ecosystem. The Trust Network Topology is the living substrate for all trust and reputation flows, underpinning the [Resonant Trust Protocol](../../protocols/resonant_trust_protocol.md) and supporting PET/Clarity, ritualized user journeys, and the symbolic economy across all [realms](../../realms/README.md).

---

## üåü Core Principles

‚úÖ **Decentralized:** No single authority‚Äîtrust is emergent, dynamic, and distributed (see [Resonant Trust Protocol](../../protocols/resonant_trust_protocol.md)).
‚úÖ **Symbolic Mapping:** Trust nodes are symbolic mirrors of collective resonance, visualized in the [Resonance Network](../../realms/resonance/resonance_network_specification.md) and surfaced through the [Resonance Network UI](../../realms/resonance/resonance_network_specification.md#ui).
‚úÖ **Consent-Layered:** Trust only grows with explicit user permission, transparency, and [PET/Clarity](../../ethics/core_values_validator.md) compliance.
‚úÖ **Ritual Framing:** Trust-building and reputation changes are enacted through symbolic rituals and user-facing ceremonies (see [Ritual Encoding Protocol](../../rituals/ritual_encoding_protocol.md)).
‚úÖ **Auditability:** All trust operations are logged and auditable via the [AI Transparency Log](../../ethics/ai_transparency_log.md).

## üõ† Implementation

- **Node Weights:** Trust scores evolve based on meaningful, value-aligned interactions and ritual participation (see [Resonant Trust Protocol](../../protocols/resonant_trust_protocol.md)).
- **Resonance Graphs:** Visual maps of trust pathways, discoverable in the [Resonance Network UI](../../realms/resonance/resonance_network_specification.md#ui).
- **Dynamic Evolution:** The topology shifts as the collective dream grows, with all changes logged in the [AI Transparency Log](../../ethics/ai_transparency_log.md).
- **Transitive Trust:** Trust can propagate through the network via explicit, auditable paths (see [Resonant Trust Protocol](../../protocols/resonant_trust_protocol.md)).
- **PET/Clarity:** All trust operations are subject to [PET/Clarity](../../ethics/core_values_validator.md), user agency, and auditability.
- **Ritual Circles:** Trust disputes or upgrades may invoke [Ritual Circles](../../rituals/ritual_encoding_protocol.md#ritual-circles) for restorative, symbolic resolution.
