# 🛡️ Security Layer

The ThinkAlike Security Layer governs **how data flows**, **what is visible**, and **what is protected** — across all modules, agents, and resonance systems.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

- Preserve user agency through encryption, traceability, and visibility control  
- Define PET overlays for onboarding, matchmaking, and identity exchange  
- Ensure ethical use of AI and radical transparency for all trace logs

---

## 🔐 Technologies Used

- **ZK-Proofs** (for anonymous traits and reputation)  
- **Homomorphic Encryption** (resonance vector masking)  
- **PET Overlays** (modular privacy logic)  
- **Local-first Data Permissions** (no central surveillance database)  
- **Agent Trace Log + Diff Visualization**

---

## 🔗 System-Level Enforcement

- All modules must obey `data_traceability_module.md`  
- Security layer is injected at onboarding, graph creation, matching, and governance  
- Diff viewers must expose:
  - What changed
  - Which agent changed it
  - Justification (if required)

---

## 🧠 Governance Integration

- Aligns with `governance_engine_spec.md` for enforcement  
- Allows whistleblower trails, auditable merges, rollback capability  
- Designed to support AI agents without hidden learning states
