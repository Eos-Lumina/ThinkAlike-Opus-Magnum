# Security Architecture

## Purpose

This directory contains documents that define the security architecture, protocols, and best practices for the ThinkAlike platform. It covers data flow security, privacy, threat modeling, and the core security layer.

## Contents

```
.
├── advanced_data_flows_security_privacy.md
├── readme.md
├── security_deep_dive.md
└── security_layer.md
```

## Key Documents

- `security_layer.md`: Defines the foundational security principles, governing data flows, visibility, and protection across the entire system.
- `security_deep_dive.md`: Provides a detailed technical exploration of the security architecture, including threat models and specific technology implementations.
- `advanced_data_flows_security_privacy.md`: Outlines the architecture for advanced data flows with a focus on integrating security and privacy.

## Usage

These documents are critical for all developers, especially those working on the backend, data infrastructure, and authentication/authorization systems. They provide the guidelines for building a secure and trustworthy platform.

## Dependencies

The security architecture is a cross-cutting concern and is tightly integrated with all other parts of the system, particularly the `data_models`, `api` specifications, and `agent_framework`.
