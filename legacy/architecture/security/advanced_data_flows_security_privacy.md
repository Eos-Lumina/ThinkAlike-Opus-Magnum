# Advanced Data Flows, Security, and Privacy Integration (Blueprint Draft)

This document details the architecture, protocols, and best practices for advanced data flows, security, and privacy in ThinkAlike.

---

## 1. Data Flow Architecture
- **Event-Driven Pipeline:** Modular ingestion, validation, processing, and storage of all data.
- **Traceability:** Every data operation is logged with a unique trace ID; lineage metadata is encrypted and auditable.
- **Validation & Verification:** All data passes through verification and traceability modules before storage or further processing.
- **Backup & Restore:** Automated, encrypted backups with regular validation and restore drills.

## 2. Security Architecture
- **Authentication & Authorization:** JWT/OAuth2 for all sensitive endpoints; strict RBAC enforced at API and database levels.
- **Encryption:** TLS 1.2+ for all traffic; database and backup encryption; application-level encryption for sensitive fields.
- **Threat Modeling:** Continuous review and update of threat models; regular penetration testing and code audits.
- **Audit Logging:** All sensitive actions and access are logged and available for review by authorized users.

## 3. Privacy & Compliance
- **Consent Enforcement:** All data processing is gated by explicit, granular user consent; consent logs are auditable.
- **Data Minimization:** Only necessary data is collected and retained; regular audits for unnecessary retention.
- **User Rights:** Users can export, modify, or delete their data at any time via UI or API.
- **Third-Party Data:** All integrations are reviewed for compliance and user control; external data is clearly marked and traceable.

## 4. Monitoring & Incident Response
- **Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring of data flows, access, and system health; alerts for anomalies or unauthorized access.
- **Incident Response:** Documented procedures for responding to security or privacy incidents; regular drills and reviews.
- **Transparency:** Users are notified of any incidents affecting their data, with clear remediation steps.

## Known Gaps & Next Steps
- Expand technical detail for new risks, compliance requirements, and emerging technologies.
- Document any new data flows, encryption methods, or incident response protocols as they are developed.
- Periodically review and update this document as part of the harmonized TODO process.

*Update this document as new risks, technologies, or compliance requirements emerge. Use as a reference for backend, compliance, and risk management.*
