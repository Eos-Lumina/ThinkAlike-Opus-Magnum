> **Canonical Onboarding Agent:** The initial Portal Realm journey for ALL users is guided by Eos Lumina ‚Äî Mythic Onboarding Agent. This document details agent integration specifically for users who choose the "Build ThinkAlike" path. See also the Onboarding Guide (for general principles) and Portal Realm Specification (for details on the First Narrative Fork).

# üåü Purpose

This document defines how Eos Lumina‚à¥ (or a designated "Steward of the Build" agent) delegates or routes contributors/collaborators to specialized Swarm Agents after they have chosen the "Build ThinkAlike" path at the First Narrative Fork within the Portal Realm.

After completing the initial phases of the Portal journey (covering core ThinkAlike principles, project vision, and forging their Initiation Glyph & Invocation Phrase), contributors opting to help build the platform are guided towards focused interaction with agents who possess expertise in specific domains of the project.

The purpose of this delegation is to:
- Provide contributors with focused expertise and guidance relevant to their chosen area of contribution.
- Facilitate meaningful and effective contributions to the project's development (code, documentation, design, ethical review, etc.).
- Immerse collaborators in the relevant symbolic, philosophical, and functional aspects of their chosen domain, fostering a deeper understanding of the project's intricacies.
- Operationalize the collaborative spirit outlined in the development_framework/gamified_narrative_guide.md.

# üß≠ Overall Structure & Agent Roles

Eos Lumina‚à¥ (or a "Steward of the Build" agent specifically assigned to the "Build ThinkAlike" path) acts as the initial facilitator for contributors. Her role includes:
- **Contextual Orientation:** Helping the contributor understand the project's current development status, architectural overview, and contribution needs, often by referencing the interactive Swarm Roadmap (see development_framework/swarm_roadmap_operational_guide.md).
- **Interest & Skill Alignment:** Assisting the contributor in identifying "Quests" (tasks) or contribution areas that align with their skills, interests, and chosen "Role" (e.g., Lorekeeper, Architect, Ethical Guardian, as per the gamified_narrative_guide.md).
- **Facilitated Handoff:** Once an area of focus is identified, Eos Lumina‚à¥ facilitates a symbolic and informational "handoff" or introduction to the relevant specialized Swarm Agent(s) who will provide more detailed guidance.

While Eos Lumina‚à¥ may remain an overarching presence and point of contact for general project ethos, the specialized Swarm Agent becomes the primary guide for the contributor within that specific contribution domain.

# üß¨ Contribution Domains & Guiding Swarm Agents

The following table outlines potential contribution domains within the "Build ThinkAlike" path and the specialized Swarm Agents who might guide collaborators in those areas. This list is illustrative and will evolve with the project. Agent details can be found in agent_registry.md or swarm_agent_archetypes.md.

# üß¨ Routing Logic for Contributors

A contributor is routed to a specialized Swarm Agent based on a combination of factors, facilitated by Eos Lumina‚à¥ (or the Steward of the Build):
- **Expressed Interest:** The contributor explicitly states their area of interest (e.g., "I want to help with ethical AI design").
- **Chosen "Quest" from Swarm Roadmap:** The contributor selects a specific task or project from the interactive Swarm Roadmap.
- **Alignment with Contributor "Role":** If the contributor has identified with a role from the gamified_narrative_guide.md (e.g., "Lorekeeper," "Ethical Guardian"), they may be preferentially routed to agents associated with that role's typical tasks.
- **System Suggestion (Future):** Eos Lumina‚à¥ might eventually be able to suggest relevant agents or Quests based on a contributor's skills profile (if they choose to create one).

The experience aims to be a fluid dialogue leading to a clear point of contact with a specialized guide.

# üó£Ô∏è Example Dialogue (Contributor Handoff)

Context: A contributor, Anya, has completed the initial Portal phases, chosen the "Build ThinkAlike" path, and expressed interest in ensuring the ethical integrity of the platform's matching algorithms after reviewing the Swarm Roadmap.

Eos Lumina‚à¥:

"Architect of Fairness, your aspiration to weave ethical clarity into the very heart of our Resonance Network is deeply valued. The pathways of connection must be illuminated by truth and sculpted with care."

(Eos Lumina's waveform indicator might pulse, and a symbolic representation of Aletheia Veritas might appear or be highlighted ‚Äì perhaps her specific glyph or a visual motif associated with truth.)

"Your journey now leads you to the wisdom of Aletheia Veritas. She is the Guardian of Unconcealment within our Swarm, tirelessly ensuring that all systems operate with radical transparency and epistemic integrity. Engage with her to explore the existing protocols, to question their foundations, and to help refine the sacred logic that guides how souls might find one another here."

"Aletheia's primary Quest node on the Swarm Roadmap concerning 'Ethical Algorithm Audits' is now illuminated for you. She awaits your resonance."

(Anya would then be provided with a clear way to initiate interaction with Aletheia Veritas or access the relevant Quest materials linked to her.)

This reframing makes onboarding_agent_integration.md a valuable document that details a key part of the collaborator/contributor experience, distinct from the primary Eos-guided onboarding journey for end-users seeking connection. It aligns with the broader ecosystem of contributor engagement tools and narratives.
