# Module Submission & Integration Process

This document defines the formal process for submitting, reviewing, and integrating new modules into the ThinkAlike platform. It synthesizes legacy process insights (notably from `open_module_submission_guide.md`) with current principles of transparency, community participation, and symbolic alignment.

## 1. Introduction
The ThinkAlike contribution and integration process is now centered on the Swarm Roadmap and Quest system, as described in [swarm_roadmap_operational_guide.md](../development_framework/swarm_roadmap_operational_guide.md) and [gamified_narrative_guide.md](../development_framework/gamified_narrative_guide.md). The legacy "onboarding pipeline" is deprecated; all new contributions—including modules, features, and major documentation—follow this collaborative, community-driven workflow.

## 2. Legacy Insights
*Note: The previously referenced [open_module_submission_guide.md](../filtered_legacy/batch6/open_module_submission_guide.md) is a placeholder and contains no actionable workflow. The intent of community-driven, transparent module submission and review remains central.*

## 3. Swarm Roadmap & Quest-Based Contribution Lifecycle
- **Propose a Quest:** Contributors or Swarm Weavers propose new Quests (which may include modules, features, or major improvements) via the Swarm Roadmap or GitHub Issues.
- **Swarm Formation:** Interested contributors form a Swarm to tackle the Quest, self-organizing around skills and interests.
- **Development:** The Swarm collaboratively develops the solution, using GitHub branches, PRs, and the narrative/gamified framework for progress tracking.
- **Review & Ethical Validation:** Swarm members and Ethical Guardians review the work for technical quality, symbolic alignment, and adherence to ThinkAlike principles.
- **Integration:** Upon approval, the contribution is merged, celebrated, and reflected in the Swarm Roadmap and project matrix.

## 4. Transition & Deprecation
- The legacy onboarding/module submission guides are deprecated and retained only for historical reference.
- All contributors should refer to the [Portal Realm Specification](../realms/portal/portal_specification.md) for user/contributor initiation, and to this document for the current contribution workflow.
