# ThinkAlike API Specifications

This directory contains the canonical, machine-readable API specifications for the ThinkAlike project, primarily defined using the **OpenAPI 3.0 standard**. These files are the single source of truth for all API endpoints, schemas, and contracts.

For general best practices that guide the design of these APIs, please refer to [`docs/architecture/api_design_guidelines.md`](../architecture/api_design_guidelines.md).

## Tooling & Usage

These OpenAPI specifications can be used with a variety of tools to enhance development:

-   **Interactive Documentation:** Use tools like [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) or [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) to generate interactive API documentation that developers can use to explore and test endpoints.
-   **Code Generation:** Use [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) to automatically generate client SDKs (for frontend consumption) or server stubs.
-   **Automated Testing:** Integrate with testing frameworks to create contract tests that ensure the implementation never deviates from the specification.
