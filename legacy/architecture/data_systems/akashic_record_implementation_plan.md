# Akashic Record Implementation Plan

- **Version:** 0.1.0
- **Status:** Draft
- **Date:** 2025-06-13
- **Author(s):** GitHub Copilot (Conceptual Draft)
- **Reviewer(s):** Architectural Stewards, Ethics Council

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

The Akashic Record is a foundational concept within the ThinkAlike ecosystem, serving as the immutable, auditable, and transparent ledger of all significant events, interactions, choices, and transformations. Its purpose is to:

-   Ensure **radical data traceability** and transparency for users and auditors.
-   Provide a historical basis for **narrative continuity and evolution** (NarrativeChoiceLog, RitualForkArchive).
-   Support **user sovereignty** by allowing users to understand and potentially export their interaction history.
-   Serve as a trusted source for **ethical oversight and verification** processes.
-   Underpin the **Chrona Currency** by recording value-exchanges and transformations.

This document outlines a high-level plan for its implementation.

## 2. Scope

The Akashic Record will capture events related to:

-   **User Lifecycle:** Account creation, profile updates, consent changes.
-   **Narrative Engine:** Narrative initiations, choices made (NarrativeChoiceLog), forks taken (RitualForkArchive), Duet interactions.
-   **Resonance Network:** Connection formations, resonance scores achieved, feedback provided.
-   **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Context creation, updates, sharing, ethical validation events.
-   **Agent Interactions:** Significant actions taken by AI agents on behalf of or in interaction with users.
-   **Ethical Oversight:** Validation events from CoreValuesValidator, AI Transparency Log entries.
-   **Chrona Currency (Future):** Transactions, transformations, decay events.
-   **Governance (Future):** Voting records, proposal submissions, role changes.

**Out of Scope for Initial MVP:**
-   Storing full raw data payloads for all events (hashes or references will be used where appropriate).
-   Real-time, high-frequency event streaming for analytics (a separate system might be needed for that).

## 3. Key Features & Functionalities

-   **Immutability:** Once an event is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted (logical deletion or amendments will be new, linked events).
-   **Auditability:** All records must be queryable for audit purposes by authorized entities (including users for their own data).
-   **Timestamping:** Every event must have a secure, reliable timestamp.
-   **Causality & Linkage:** Events should be linkable to preceding events or causal chains where applicable (e.g., a narrative choice is linked to the narrative step).
-   **User Access & Export:** Users must be able to view and export their relevant portions of the Akashic Record in a human-readable and machine-parsable format.
-   **Standardized Event Schema:** A well-defined, extensible schema for events.
-   **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle a growing volume of events.
-   **Security:** Robust access controls and encryption to protect sensitive data.
-   **Privacy by Design:** Ensure that only necessary data is recorded and that user privacy is paramount. Anonymization or pseudonymization techniques will be explored for aggregated views.

## 4. Proposed Technical Architecture

This section outlines potential technologies. Final choices will be subject to ADRs.

### 4.1. Core Ledger Technology Options:

1.  **Immutable Log-Structured Database:**
    -   **Examples:** Apache Kafka (as a commit log), specialized append-only databases (e.g., Noms, Dolt, or custom solutions leveraging Merkle trees).
    -   **Pros:** High throughput for writes, strong immutability guarantees, natural fit for event sourcing.
    -   **Cons:** Querying can be complex; may require separate systems for rich querying and views.
2.  **Blockchain/Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) - Private/Consortium:**
    -   **Examples:** Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, or a custom private blockchain.
    -   **Pros:** Strong immutability, decentralization potential (if Hives become independent), built-in auditability.
    -   **Cons:** Higher complexity, potential performance overhead for high-volume events, governance of the chain.
3.  **Temporal Databases with Immutability Features:**
    -   **Examples:** PostgreSQL with temporal tables and strict append-only logic, dedicated temporal databases.
    -   **Pros:** Leverages existing relational database expertise, good querying capabilities.
    -   **Cons:** Ensuring true immutability at the application layer can be challenging; may not scale as well for extremely high write loads as log-structured systems.

**Initial Recommendation:** Explore a **Log-Structured Database approach (Option 1)** for the core event log due to its write performance and natural fit for event sourcing. This can be complemented by a separate **graph database or document database (Option 4.3)** for building queryable views and relationships.

### 4.2. Event Schema & Serialization:

-   **Schema Definition:** Use a schema definition language like Apache Avro, Protocol Buffers, or JSON Schema for event payloads. This ensures consistency and allows for schema evolution.
-   **Serialization:** Binary serialization (Avro, Protobuf) for efficiency, or JSON for human readability in certain contexts.

### 4.3. Querying & Indexing Layer:

-   **Purpose:** To provide efficient querying and access to the Akashic Record without directly impacting the raw immutable log.
-   **Technology Options:**
    -   **Graph Database (e.g., Neo4j, ArangoDB):** Excellent for modeling relationships between events, users, and entities.
    -   **Document Database (e.g., MongoDB, Elasticsearch):** Good for flexible querying of event data.
    -   **Stream Processing (e.g., Apache Flink, ksqlDB):** To build materialized views and indexes from the event log in real-time.

### 4.4. API & Access Control:

-   **API:** A secure, versioned API (e.g., GraphQL or REST) for writing events (internal, trusted services only) and querying events (with appropriate access controls).
-   **Access Control:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) integrated with ThinkAlike's User & Identity Services. Users can only access their own data or data they have explicit consent for. Ethical oversight roles will have specific, audited access.

## 5. Data Model (Conceptual)

Each Akashic Record entry (Event) could have a structure like:

```json
{
  "eventId": "uuid", // Unique event identifier
  "timestamp": "ISO8601_datetime_utc", // Secure timestamp
  "version": "integer", // Event schema version
  "eventType": "string", // e.g., USER_PROFILE_UPDATE, NARRATIVE_CHOICE_MADE, MCP_CONTEXT_VALIDATED
  "sourceSystem": "string", // e.g., NarrativeEngine, PortalRealmService, UserIdentityService
  "userId": "uuid", // Identifier for the primary user involved (if applicable)
  "agentId": "uuid", // Identifier for the AI agent involved (if applicable)
  "contextId": "uuid", // Link to MCP context or other relevant contexts
  "causalEventId": "uuid", // Link to a preceding event that caused this one (optional)
  "payloadSchemaURI": "uri", // URI to the specific schema for this event's payload
  "payload": {
    // Event-specific data, structured according to payloadSchemaURI
    // Example for NARRATIVE_CHOICE_MADE:
    // "narrativeId": "uuid",
    // "stepId": "string",
    // "choiceId": "string",
    // "outcome": "string"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "ipAddressHash": "string_hash", // (Anonymized where possible)
    "deviceType": "string"
  },
  "signature": "string" // Cryptographic signature to ensure integrity (optional, depends on ledger tech)
}
```

## 6. Security & Privacy Considerations

-   **Encryption:** Data at rest and in transit must be encrypted.
-   **Data Minimization:** Only essential data should be stored in the Akashic Record. Sensitive PII should be referenced via IDs rather than stored directly if possible, or be subject to strong encryption and access controls.
-   **Anonymization/Pseudonymization:** For aggregated views or analytics, data should be anonymized or pseudonymized.
-   **Access Control:** Strict RBAC and audit logs for all access to the Akashic Record.
-   **Immutable Audit Trail:** The record itself serves as an audit trail, but access to it must also be logged.
-   **User Consent:** Event recording related to user data must align with user consent preferences.

## 7. Phased Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Ledger & Event Ingestion (MVP)

-   **Goal:** Establish the foundational immutable log and basic event ingestion pipeline.
-   **Tasks:**
    1.  Finalize choice of core ledger technology (ADR).
    2.  Define initial core event schemas (e.g., user creation, basic narrative events).
    3.  Implement a secure event ingestion API.
    4.  Set up basic infrastructure for the chosen ledger.
    5.  Integrate with User & Identity Service for `USER_ACCOUNT_CREATED` event.
    6.  Integrate with PortalRealmService for `NARRATIVE_INITIATED` and `NARRATIVE_CHOICE_MADE` (simplified).
-   **Deliverables:** Functional core ledger, API for event submission, basic event types recorded.

### Phase 2: Querying, User Access & Broader Integration

-   **Goal:** Enable basic querying, provide initial user access to their data, and integrate more event sources.
-   **Tasks:**
    1.  Implement a basic querying layer (e.g., views on the log or a simple document store replica).
    2.  Develop a user-facing component (e.g., within DataTraceability UI) for users to view their recorded events.
    3.  Define and implement schemas for MCP events, ethical validation events.
    4.  Integrate with MCP Handler and Ethical Oversight Services.
    5.  Develop initial data export functionality for users.
-   **Deliverables:** Basic query API, user view of their Akashic Record, MCP events recorded.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Scalability

-   **Goal:** Enhance scalability, implement advanced querying, and prepare for future integrations like Chrona Currency.
-   **Tasks:**
    1.  Implement advanced indexing and querying capabilities (e.g., graph database integration).
    2.  Conduct performance and scalability testing.
    3.  Develop more sophisticated audit tools for oversight.
    4.  Define schemas for Chrona Currency events (if design is ready).
    5.  Refine security and privacy controls based on operational experience.
-   **Deliverables:** Scalable Akashic Record system, advanced querying, robust audit tools.

## 8. Open Questions & Future Considerations

-   Specific technology choices for each component (to be decided via ADRs).
-   Long-term archival strategy for the immutable log.
-   Data retention policies and compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR right to be forgotten – how to handle with an immutable log, likely via cryptographic erasure or referencing).
-   Detailed disaster recovery and business continuity plan.
-   Integration with real-time analytics platforms if needed.

This implementation plan provides a starting point. Each phase will require more detailed technical design and planning.
