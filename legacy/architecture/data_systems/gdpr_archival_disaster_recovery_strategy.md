# GDPR, Archival, and Disaster Recovery Strategy (Blueprint Draft)

This document outlines the strategy for GDPR compliance, long-term data archival, and disaster recovery for ThinkAlike. It is designed to ensure legal compliance, user rights, and system resilience.

---

## 1. GDPR Compliance
- **Right to be Forgotten:** Implement cryptographic erasure for immutable logs (e.g., Akashic Record) by deleting encryption keys or using reference-based deletion.
- **Data Minimization:** Collect and retain only necessary data; regularly audit for unnecessary retention.
- **User Rights:** Provide UI and API for users to export, modify, or delete their data.
- **Consent Management:** Maintain granular, auditable consent records for all data processing.
- **Third-Party Data:** Ensure all integrations (e.g., external APIs) comply with GDPR and user consent.

## 2. Long-Term Archival
- **Immutable Event Ledger:** Use append-only, log-structured storage for critical events (Akashic Record).
- **Archival Policy:** Define retention periods for different data types; move old data to cold storage as needed.
- **Access Controls:** Restrict access to archived data; log all access and retrieval events.
- **Compliance Audits:** Schedule regular reviews of archival and retention practices.

## 3. Disaster Recovery
- **Backup Strategy:** Regular, encrypted backups of all critical data (including Akashic Record, user profiles, and configuration).
- **Recovery Plan:** Documented procedures for restoring from backup, including contact points and escalation paths.
- **Testing:** Periodic disaster recovery drills to validate backup integrity and recovery speed.
- **Business Continuity:** Ensure minimal downtime and data loss in the event of system failure or attack.

## 4. Known Gaps & Next Steps
- Select and document technologies for cryptographic erasure and immutable log management.
- Finalize and publish retention periods and archival policies for all data types.
- Integrate compliance and recovery checks into CI/CD and monitoring pipelines.
- Add compliance monitoring dashboard and periodic audit schedule.
- Update this document as regulations, technologies, or system architecture evolve.
