# Simulation: Governance & Trust Protocol User Flows

This simulation traces a user's experience joining a Hive, participating in governance, and building trust, surfacing integration points and blueprint gaps.

---

## 1. Joining a Hive (Community)
- **What happens:** The user browses available Hives and requests to join one that matches their interests or values.
- **Expected user experience:**
  - User can search, filter, and view Hive details (purpose, members, governance rules).
  - Request to join is sent and processed (may require approval or automatic acceptance).
  - User receives confirmation and is added as a HiveMember with a specific role.
- **Blueprint check:**
  - Hive and HiveMember models must support roles, join requests, and status.
  - UI must provide clear join/leave flows and display governance info.

## 2. Participating in Governance
- **What happens:** The user proposes, discusses, and votes on community decisions (e.g., rules, projects, resource allocation).
- **Expected user experience:**
  - Access to a governance dashboard showing active proposals, voting status, and past decisions.
  - Ability to submit new proposals, comment, and cast votes.
  - Transparent display of results and audit trail for all governance actions.
- **Blueprint check:**
  - HiveGovernance model must support proposals, voting, and audit.
  - UI must provide accessible, transparent governance tools.
  - Audit and traceability endpoints must be available.

## 3. Building Trust & Reputation
- **What happens:** The userâ€™s actions and contributions build trust and reputation within the Hive and broader community.
- **Expected user experience:**
  - Trust indicators (badges, scores, endorsements) are visible on user profiles.
  - Users can give/receive endorsements, feedback, or restorative trust actions.
  - Full transparency and user control over what trust data is shared.
- **Blueprint check:**
  - Trust protocol and data model must support multi-layered, contextual trust (not just a static score).
  - UI must allow users to manage trust indicators and privacy.
  - All trust actions must be auditable and reversible.

## Gaps & Recommendations
- [ ] Ensure Hive, HiveMember, and HiveGovernance models support all required fields and flows.
- [ ] Complete governance dashboard and proposal/voting UI specs.
- [ ] Specify trust protocol, indicators, and user privacy controls in detail.
- [ ] Add/clarify audit and traceability endpoints for governance and trust actions.
- [ ] Cross-link governance and trust docs in the blueprint and protocol overview.

*Update this simulation as the blueprint evolves. Use it to validate governance and trust flows and ensure a robust, user-friendly experience.*
