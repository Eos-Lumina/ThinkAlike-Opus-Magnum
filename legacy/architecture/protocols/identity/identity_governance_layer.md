# Identity Governance Layer

## üß≠ Purpose

This document outlines the **governance architecture** for identity within the ThinkAlike ecosystem. It establishes mechanisms for **credential issuance**, **fork validation**, **community verification**, and **collective resolution of identity conflicts** ‚Äî all while upholding the principles of **cognitive liberty**, **ethical transparency**, and **post-national plurality**.

---

## üîê Governance Principles

1. **Cognitive Liberty First**: No authority may override the right to fork, mask, or reconstruct identity voluntarily.
2. **Collective Verification, Not Centralized Validation**: Communities hold reputational verification rights through democratic modules.
3. **Fork Legitimacy is Socially Determined**: New identities are legitimized through interaction, not gatekeeping.
4. **Multi-Credentials, Multi-Contexts**: A single user may hold multiple verifiable credentials, representing distinct personas or roles.
5. **Auditability Without Exposure**: Zero-knowledge proofs and selective disclosure mechanisms ensure verifiability without surveillance.

## üß¨ Credential Types

| Type                    | Purpose                                   | Issuer              |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Proof of Contribution** | Civic participation, code commits, knowledge uploads | DAO, Project        |
| **Resonance Verification** | Value alignment check-ins (semi-automated) | System + Peer Circle |
| **Reputation Tokens**     | Context-specific earned trust            | Liquid Peer Assembly |
| **Onboarding Completion** | Narrative walkthrough / initiation ritual passed | System              |
| **Community Credential**  | Accepted and trusted within specific circles or nodes | Community Nodes     |

## üß∞ Modules

### 1. **Credentialing Engine**
- Verifiable Credential (VC) minting and revocation
- Based on W3C standards
- Connects with Liquid Democracy and Synergistic Field

### 2. **Fork Ledger & Resolver**
- Distributed registry of voluntary forks
- Timestamped declarations + reasons
- Fork legitimacy is adjudicated through community recognition

### 3. **Reputation Orbit**
- Non-transferable, non-monetary rep tokens
- Issued through democratic workflows (vote, participation, review)
- Granular to context (e.g., ‚ÄúMutual Aid Organizer‚Äù in Node X)

### 4. **Community-Defined Credentials**
- Communities propose, vote, and maintain local credential types
- Codified using ThinkAlike‚Äôs open governance contracts

### 5. **Zero-Knowledge Interface Layer**
- Allows individuals to prove identity traits (e.g., age, participation) without revealing full details

## ‚öñÔ∏è Dispute Resolution

1. **Disputes are Always Contextual**: Reputation disputes occur within circles, not global courts.
2. **Consensus Mechanism**: Uses quadratic voting or token-weighted deliberation.
3. **Public Ledger of Disputes**: Transparent logs of all disputes and their outcomes.
4. **Appeals Layer**: Appeals handled by network-wide citizen juries drawn randomly from verified contributors.

---

## üîó Linkages

- **Liquid Democracy**: Voting rights and proposals tied to verified identities
- **Otium Protocols**: Identity-linked access to reflection and resonance environments
- **Community Protocols**: On-chain reputation gates for participation, moderation, or governance

---

## üß© Role in Ecosystem

Identity Governance Layer powers:

- Ethical onboarding (linked to Mode 1)
- Access control for post-national governance (linked to World Parliament)
- Distributed proof of expertise and values
- Trust without surveillance
- Transparent but non-intrusive civic coordination

---

## üå± Future Development

- Integration of AI reputation scoring models (open-source only)
- Portable DID/VC identities across partner networks
- Interoperable dispute frameworks with partner DAOs and protocols
