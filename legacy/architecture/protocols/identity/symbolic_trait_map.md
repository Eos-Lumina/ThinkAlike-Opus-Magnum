# 🧭 Symbolic Trait Map

This map visualizes how onboarding decisions shape a user’s identity vector. It is the core grammar for ThinkAlike’s resonance and matching layers.

---

## 🧬 Trait Clusters

- Curiosity ↔ Obedience  
- Courage ↔ Preservation  
- Coherence ↔ Contradiction  
- Mysticism ↔ Materialism  
- Pluralism ↔ Certainty  
- Resilience ↔ Comfort-seeking  
- Silence ↔ Signaling

## 🔗 Fork Reflections

Each fork in onboarding connects to traits using symbolic logic.
Example:

> **“You chose to explore a paradox.”** → `pluralism`, `curiosity`, `resilience`

---

> “Traits are not scores. They are vectors of becoming.”
