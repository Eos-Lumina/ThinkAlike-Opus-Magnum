# Internationalization (i18n) & Translation Management Recommendations

This document provides actionable recommendations for frameworks and tools to support multilingual accessibility in ThinkAlike.

---

## 1. Frontend i18n Frameworks
- **i18next** (React/Next.js):
  - Widely used, robust, and well-documented.
  - Supports dynamic loading, pluralization, context, and language detection.
  - Integrates with Next.js, React, and other modern frameworks.
- **react-intl**:
  - Good for projects focused on React ecosystem.
  - Supports ICU message formatting and locale data.

## 2. Translation Management Tools
- **Lokalise**:
  - Cloud-based, collaborative translation platform.
  - Integrates with i18next, GitHub, and CI/CD pipelines.
  - Supports translation memory, review workflows, and in-context editing.
- **Crowdin**:
  - Similar to Lokalise, with strong open-source and community project support.
  - API and CLI for automation.
- **Phrase**:
  - Enterprise-grade, with advanced workflow and integration features.

## 3. Backend/API i18n
- **gettext** or **Babel** (Python):
  - For backend error messages, prompts, and agent responses.
  - Use .po/.mo files for translations.
- **Custom JSON/YAML**:
  - For agent persona scripts, narrative content, and protocol docs.
  - Store translations in structured files for easy update and review.

## 4. Best Practices
- Design all UI, onboarding, and narrative flows for easy translation (no hardcoded text).
- Use language keys and fallback logic throughout the stack.
- Prioritize translation of user-facing guides, onboarding, and agent/narrative content.
- Involve community contributors in translation review and feedback.
