# System Protocols

## Purpose

This directory contains the detailed specifications, simulations, and plain-language guides for the core protocols that govern interaction within the ThinkAlike ecosystem. These documents define the rules and flows for agents, data, economy, and governance.

## Key Documents

- `protocols_overview.md`: A master document that outlines and links to all major ThinkAlike protocols.
- `model_context_protocol_specification.md`: The technical specification for how AI agents handle contextual data.
- **Plain-Language Guides**: A series of documents that explain complex systems (like the Chrona Wallet and Governance) in simple, non-technical terms.
- **Simulations**: Documents that trace user flows through different protocols to identify gaps and integration points.
- **UI/UX Outlines**: Drafts that define the user experience for key interfaces like the Chrona Wallet and Governance Dashboard.

## Usage

These documents are essential for developers, designers, and architects building and maintaining the ThinkAlike platform. They provide the blueprint for implementing user-facing features and backend systems.

## Dependencies

These protocols are tightly integrated with the system's `data_models`, `api` specifications, and `agent_framework`.
