# Plain-Language Guide: Governance & Trust in ThinkAlike

This guide explains, in simple terms, how you can join communities (Hives), participate in decisions, and build trust in ThinkAlike. No technical knowledge required!

---

## 1. Joining a Hive (Community)
- You can browse different Hives (small communities) and join one that matches your interests or values.
- Each Hive has its own purpose, members, and ways of making decisions.
- Sometimes you join instantly, other times you may need approval.

## 2. Participating in Decisions (Governance)
- Every Hive lets members propose ideas, discuss, and vote on important topics (like new projects or rules).
- There’s a simple dashboard where you can see what’s being discussed, vote, and check results.
- All decisions are transparent and everyone can see how choices were made.

## 3. Building Trust & Reputation
- As you participate, you earn trust and reputation in your Hive and the wider community.
- Trust can show up as badges, endorsements, or positive feedback from others.
- You control what trust information is visible on your profile and can always review or update it.

## 4. Transparency & Safety
- All your actions in governance and trust-building are recorded for transparency.
- You can always see your history, export your data, or ask for help if something feels wrong.
- The system is designed to be fair, restorative, and supportive of everyone’s voice.

---

**Why this matters:**
- You help shape your community and make real decisions.
- Trust is earned through participation, not just numbers or scores.
- You are always in control of your reputation and privacy.
