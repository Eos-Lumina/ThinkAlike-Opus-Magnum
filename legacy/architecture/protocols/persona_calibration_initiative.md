# Persona Calibration Initiative (PCI) Specification

> **Status:** In Development
> **Version:** 1.0
> **Maintained by:** ThinkAlike Core Team
> **Integration Point:** Portal Realm, Eos Lumina System

---

## Overview

The Persona Calibration Initiative (PCI) is a voluntary system where ThinkAlike contributors can create detailed "Test Persona Profiles" to help test, validate, and refine ThinkAlike's matching, personalization, and insight-generating algorithms. This system strictly adheres to ThinkAlike's core principles of User Sovereignty, Radical Transparency, and Ethical AI.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. User Sovereignty
Contributors have absolute control over:
- Their participation decision
- The data they share
- How their data is used for testing
- Data retention and deletion

### 2. Radical Transparency (UI as Validation)
Every step must be exceptionally clear:
- What data is being requested and why
- How it will be used in algorithm testing
- Results of any tests involving their profile
- Clear visibility into all processes

### 3. Ethical AI (Eos Lumina as Steward)
Eos Lumina∴ facilitates this process as an ethical guide:
- Ensures informed consent at every step
- Provides clarity and context
- Champions contributor agency
- Acts as partner in co-creation, not data harvester

### 4. Purpose Limitation
PCI data is exclusively for algorithm testing and refinement by the contributor pool. It is firewalled from other uses unless explicit, separate consent is given.

### 5. Voluntary Participation
No contributor is ever required to participate. PCI is strictly opt-in for those wishing to help refine the platform's core intelligence.

## System Architecture

### Phase 1: Foundation & Consent Framework

#### 1.1. Opt-In Mechanism
- Dedicated PCI section in contributor interface
- Clear explanatory content delivered by Eos Lumina∴
- Explicit opt-in action with informed consent
- Granular consent options for different data types

#### 1.2. Eos Lumina Dialogue System
- Introduction scripts explaining PCI purpose
- Consent process guidance
- Ongoing support and clarification
- Ethical checkpoints throughout the process

#### 1.3. Test Persona Profile Data Structure
```typescript
interface TestPersonaProfile {
  contributor_id: string; // Pseudonymized for algorithm runs
  consent_status: {
    pci_opt_in: boolean;
    last_updated: timestamp;
    granular_permissions: {
      symbolic_responses: boolean;
      value_priorities: boolean;
      narrative_shares: boolean;
      preference_tags: boolean;
    };
  };
  profile_creation_date: timestamp;
  profile_last_modified: timestamp;
  data: {
    symbolic_responses: SymbolicResponse[];
    value_priorities: ValuePriority[];
    narrative_shares: NarrativeShare[];
    preference_tags: PreferenceTag[];
  };
  usage_log: AlgorithmTestUsage[];
}
```

#### 1.4. Profile Dashboard
- Consent status overview
- Data sharing preferences
- Usage history and transparency
- Clear opt-out/withdrawal mechanism

### Phase 2: Profile Building Mechanisms

#### 2.1. Symbolic Questions Integration
- Interface for Eos Lumina∴ to present symbolic questions
- Response capture and storage
- Clear context for each question's purpose

#### 2.2. Value Prioritization Module
- Interactive value exploration and ranking
- Custom explanations for priority choices
- Integration with existing value frameworks

#### 2.3. Narrative Sharing Module
- Secure narrative capture
- Sensitivity tagging
- Anonymization options
- Specific consent for algorithmic use

#### 2.4. Preference Tagging Module
- Diverse stimuli presentation
- Reaction tagging system
- Context-aware categorization

### Phase 3: Algorithm Test Bench & Feedback Loop

#### 3.1. Algorithm Selection Interface
- Developer/tester access controls
- Profile selection (anonymized/pseudonymized)
- Test parameter configuration

#### 3.2. Test Execution & Results
- Algorithm trigger mechanisms
- Result display with reasoning
- Transparency for profile usage

#### 3.3. Contributor Feedback System
- Result presentation to contributors
- Structured feedback collection
- Algorithm refinement input

### Phase 4: Data Governance & Algorithm Refinement

#### 4.1. Data Governance
- Retention policies
- Anonymization strategies
- Regular audit procedures
- Compliance monitoring

#### 4.2. Algorithm Improvement Cycle
- Feedback integration processes
- Iterative refinement workflows
- Performance tracking
