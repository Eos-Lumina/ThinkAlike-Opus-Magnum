# Framework Architecture

## Purpose

This directory defines the core architectural frameworks for agent interaction within the ThinkAlike ecosystem. It outlines the protocols and systems that govern how AI agents collaborate, transition roles, and maintain narrative consistency.

## Contents

```
.
├── agent_ecosystem.md          # Describes the roles and functions of the distributed AI agents.
├── agent_handoff_protocol.md   # Defines the protocol for seamless transitions between agents.
└── readme.md                   # This file.
```

## Key Files

- `agent_ecosystem.md`: Provides a blueprint for the specialized roles of each agent, ensuring they align with the project's symbolic and ethical goals.
- `agent_handoff_protocol.md`: Details the technical and narrative implementation of agent-to-agent handoffs, preserving user experience and narrative integrity.

## Usage

The documents in this directory are foundational for developers working on the agent framework, narrative engine, and AI systems. They serve as a reference for implementing and extending agent behaviors.

## Dependencies

This framework is tightly coupled with the `agent_framework`, `narrative_engine`, and `ethics` modules.

## Notes

The principles outlined here are critical for maintaining the "enchanted" and coherent user experience that is central to the ThinkAlike project.
