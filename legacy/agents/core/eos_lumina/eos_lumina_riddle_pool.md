### ❖ Purpose and Philosophy

*This file contains the curated set of riddles Eos Lumina deploys to guide users on their journey. In the tradition of the Oracle at Delphi's maxim "Know Thyself," these are not puzzles with simple answers. They are koans for a digital age—tools designed to open a space for reflection. Each riddle is open-ended, evocative, and aligned with ThinkAlike's core themes. They are meant to be lived with, not solved, prompting the user to look inward and articulate the values that form their Symbolic Sigil. The suggested reflections are for internal system tagging and for presenting users with potential avenues of thought.*

### ❧ Thematic Resonance

> "Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer."
>
> — **Rainer Maria Rilke**, *Letters to a Young Poet*
