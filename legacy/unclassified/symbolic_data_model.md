## 🧭 Purpose

The ThinkAlike system stores and organizes data symbolically, rather than behaviorally. This model structures user input, fork trails, glyphs, and overlay states for ethical processing.

---

## 📦 Key Structures

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GlyphTag` | Symbolic expression (e.g., “Emergent Friction”) |
| `ForkTrail` | Chain of onboarding or module decisions |
| `EchoOverlay` | User-controlled consent visibility |
| `ResonanceLink` | Transient symbolic match between users or agents |

---

## 🧪 Example Schema (ForkTrail)

```yaml
fork_id: bloom_veil_001
timestamp: 2025-04-30T20:32Z
tags: ["Curiosity", "Silence"]
glyphs: ["Veil", "Echo"]
consent_level: Echo
module: mirror_mode
```

🔐 Compliance
Fully PET-aligned

Exportable in JSON or human-readable glyph paths

Works across modules and agent calls
