## 🧭 Purpose

This module governs ThinkAlike’s perception and use of time. It coordinates asynchronous collaboration, swarming patterns, and ethical scheduling. It replaces linear time urgency with rhythm, resonance, and voluntary synchronicity.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Asynchronous Swarm Timing**  
  Assigns roles or projects across global time zones while preserving mental wellness.

- **Clarity-Based Deadlines**  
  Tasks are not timed for efficiency but for readiness, reflection, and shared rhythm.

- **Rhythmic Checkpoints**  
  Use symbolic time-based pulses (e.g., “dawn update,” “twilight sync”) instead of dates.

- **Chrona-Aware Energy Mapping**  
  Tracks when users are most aligned or available — not just when they are online.
