# ✨ Illuminated Values Matrix — ThinkAlike

## Purpose

The Illuminated Values Matrix is the living map of ThinkAlike’s ethical, philosophical, and operational DNA. It guides all certification, onboarding, module design, and community practices, ensuring every actor and artifact aligns with Enlightenment 2.0 principles.

## Core Pillars (Enlightenment 2.0)

1. **Positive Anarchism** — Decentralized, non-coercive, and participatory structures
2. **Ethical Humanism** — Centering dignity, care, and flourishing for all
3. **Radical Transparency** — Open processes, explainable AI, and traceable data
4. **User Empowerment** — Consent, sovereignty, and meaningful agency
5. **Authentic Connection** — Deep resonance, narrative alignment, and trust
6. **Redefined Progress** — Value measured by collective well-being, not extraction
