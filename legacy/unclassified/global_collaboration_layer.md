- PET-governed contribution flows
- Global trust badge constellation
- Optional linkage to UN SDGs or community governance overlays

---

## 🔁 Use Cases

- Schedule synchronous Dream Fork convergences
- Initiate collective rituals for module launches or burns

---

## 🔐 Ethics Layer

- Fork visibility always user-controlled
- Chrona usage patterns anonymized and symbolic
- Consent matrix governs each convergence event
