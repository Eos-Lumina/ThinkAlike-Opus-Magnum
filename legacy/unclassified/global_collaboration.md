## 🧭 Purpose

This module enables coordinated collaboration across regions, cultures, languages, and communities. It allows ThinkAlike contributors to synchronize efforts, share goals, and respond to global needs — while maintaining symbolic autonomy and PET transparency.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Time-Zoned Swarm Scheduling**  
  Contributors sync effort across time zones using resonance anchors and temporal dynamics.

- **Cultural Translation Bridge**  
  Integration with ThinkAlike’s localization system to allow multilingual coordination with PET clarity.

- **Shared Intent Graphs**  
  Swarm agents and human users co-create intent graphs to visualize alignment, gaps, or tensions.

- **Task Matching via Resonance**  
  Users are invited to initiatives based on ethical and philosophical alignment, not productivity metrics.

- **Emergency Global Response Mode**  
  Can activate planetary swarming on urgent issues like disasters, injustice, or ecological need.
