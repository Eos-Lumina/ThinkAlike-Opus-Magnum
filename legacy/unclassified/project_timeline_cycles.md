## ðŸ§­ Purpose

Rather than sprints or deadlines, ThinkAlike evolves through **symbolic cycles** â€” each representing an archetypal phase of emergence, refinement, and reflection.

---

## ðŸ“† Default Cycle Structure

| Cycle | Phase Name | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | Initiation | Fork-based experimentation |
| 2 | Resonance | Alignment across modules begins |
| 3 | Bloom | Forks converge, ethics harmonized |
| 4 | Divergence | Parallel forks split into experimental directions |
| 5 | Crystallization | MVP traits converge, symbolic badge assignment |

---

## ðŸ”— Governance Link

At the end of each cycle:

- Collective Reflection Log is updated
- Dream Fork review proposed
- Community rituals (like certs, glyphs, or burn votes) occur
