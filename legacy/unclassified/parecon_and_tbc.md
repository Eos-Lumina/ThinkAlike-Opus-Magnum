## ⚖️ Participatory Economics & Time-Based Currency (TBC)

## 🎯 Purpose

To outline ThinkAlike’s non-extractive, effort-based economic framework. We combine **Parecon (Participatory Economics)** with a symbolic **Time-Based Currency** to reward meaningful contribution.

## 🧩 Core Components

| TBC | Time-based token (Chrona ⧖) earned for community work |
| Effort Valuation | Based on time, complexity, and ethics — not market demand |
