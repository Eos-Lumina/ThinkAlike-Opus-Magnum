## 🏛️ Governance Engine Specification

This specification defines how decisions are made, moderated, and reversed within the ThinkAlike ecosystem. It supports both consensus-driven processes and minority voice preservation, and is designed for modular, cross-module governance.

## 🧭 Design Principles

- Consent > control
- Visibility > authority
- Participation weighted by contribution, not capital
- Modular logic allows governance per module or across global system
- All actions are logged and auditable (Chrona Ledger)
- Minority voices can trigger review/escalation

---

## Core Features

- **Proposal System:** Any user can propose changes, features, or policies for any module or the global system.
- **Voting Mechanisms:** Supports direct voting, delegated (liquid) voting, and weighted participation.
- **Dispute Resolution:** Transparent, auditable process for resolving conflicts or appeals.
- **Audit Trail:** All governance actions are recorded on the Chrona Ledger for transparency and compliance.
- **Integration:** Works with Identity Federation for user verification and privacy, and with all core modules for participatory governance.

## Integration Points

- **Module Integration:** Each module can have its own governance logic, or participate in global governance.
- **Identity Federation:** Ensures privacy-preserving, accountable participation.
- **Chrona Ledger:** All actions are logged for auditability and compliance.
