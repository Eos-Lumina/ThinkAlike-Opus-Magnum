# Media Instructions

This document outlines the guidelines for creating media assets (images, videos, sounds) for the ThinkAlike platform, with a focus on consistency, accessibility, and ethical design.

## General Guidelines

*   **Accessibility:** All media must be accessible to users with disabilities (clear alternative text for images, closed captions for videos, transcripts for audio). All components must be validated with UI test implementations.
*   **Performance:** Media must be optimized for performance on different devices and network conditions. Use data visualization to measure performance during each workflow implementation.
*   **Ethical Implementation:** All media should be aligned with the core values of the platform, that promote diversity, inclusivity, user agency, and also, with clear data traceability and transparency.
*   **Data Driven Parameters:** All media should be designed to have specific data parameters, to be used during UI tests and implementation workflows.

## Image Guidelines

*   **Types:** Use PNG for UI components, JPEG for photographs, and SVG for vector graphics and icons, based on their specific use.
*   **Style:** Use authentic, diverse, and high-quality images that reflect real human connections. Avoid using generic stock photography. All images should be aligned with the core values of the project. Make sure that every implementation is a response to real data, and that the style enhances usability.
*   **Sizes:**
    *   **Icons:** 24x24 pixels, 32x32 pixels, and 48x48 pixels. All icons must be scalable.
    *   **Profile Avatars:** 200x200 pixels, circular format. All avatars must follow the same design style, and also implement data to validate user information.
    *   **Background Images:** 1920x1080 pixels (or similar sizes for different screen formats).
    *   **Header Images:** 1200x400 pixels.
*   **Accessibility:** Always provide descriptive alternative text for all images. UI components must also implement validation testing workflows based on user preferences.

## Video Guidelines

*   **Format:** Use H.264 (mp4) for video compression, with clear parameters for resolution and frame rates that enhance user experience, but also, data handling performance, and scalability.
*   **Duration:**
    *   Intro Videos: 10 to 20 seconds.
    *   Profile Videos: 30 seconds to 1 minute.
*   **Audio:** Implement clear and balanced audio, and with data workflows to validate that implementation.
*   **Accessibility:** Subtitles and closed captions for all videos, and a clear validation framework to validate that performance with reusable UI components.

## Sound Guidelines

*   **Purpose:** Use audio to enhance feedback, notifications, and to validate user actions, while also testing those implementations with user feedback to make sure that they are useful and not intrusive for the user workflow.
*   **Format:** Use standard audio formats (mp3, wav, or ogg).
*   **Duration:** Use short and concise audio cues that do not produce sensory overload, using real time data to validate user response to those implementations.
*   **Accessibility:** All audio elements must include alternative descriptions or visual indicators, and also, a clear data workflow to validate that implementation for people with hearing limitations.

## Design Style:

*   **Nodes Map:** UI should use interconnected nodes and lines to represent data connections, and to show how data is moving in the system and how it affects Al choices.
*   **Pulsating Light:** The AI agent indicator will be a circular shape with a warm, deep orange light at its center and with subtle blue accents in a dark background. The light at the center of the circle should have a subtle “pulsating light” animation that emulates a heartbeat or a rhythmic flow of energy. This circle will contain an almost imperceptible *triangle shape* within its boundaries. This triangle must be extremely subtle, and it might be visible as an outline that changes very softly during the "pulsating light" animation. The *sinusoidal waveform* will pass over that UI graphic when the agent “talks” or performs an action. Both the intensity of the central light, and the movement of the waveform, must provide feedback about the Al processing, data handling and user action phases.

## Device-Specific Considerations:

*   **Screen Sizes:** Use a responsive design implementation to support different screen resolutions for mobile, desktop, and dedicated devices.
*   **Touch Interactions:** Use clear data driven parameters to test touch targets, swipe gestures, and other user interactions on mobile and touch-based devices, by providing reusable test parameters.
*   **Mouse and Keyboard Inputs:** UI must be also tested to use keyboard and mouse interaction with clear accessibility guidelines and that workflow, must be also tested with UI components.
