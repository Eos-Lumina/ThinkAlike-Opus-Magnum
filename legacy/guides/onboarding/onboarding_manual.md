## 1. Project Overview & Core Values

**ThinkAlike is the Alchemical Interface Initiative.**

ThinkAlike is not just a platform—it is a living mythos, a post-capitalist, resonance-driven ecosystem where technology is wielded as theurgy: a sacred art of worldmaking. **ThinkAlike is not just a product. It is a living, co-evolving ethical ecosystem.** Our mission is to architect a new social reality, grounded in user sovereignty, cognitive liberty, and emergent co-creativity. Every interaction is a ritual, every contribution a spell in the ongoing co-creation of a world worthy of the soul.

**Core Principles & Values:**
- **User Sovereignty & Cognitive Liberty:** You own your data, your narrative, your becoming.
- **Radical Transparency (PET/Clarity):** All flows—data, code, governance—are open, auditable, and clear.
- **Symbolic & Ritual UX:** Every interface is a portal; every action is meaningful and mythically resonant.
- **Emergent Co-Creativity:** The system evolves through the interplay of unique contributors, not top-down control.
- **Community & Commons:** All code, knowledge, and symbolic assets are held in trust for the collective.
- **Ethical AI:** All agents and algorithms are designed for alignment, transparency, and bias mitigation.
- **Inclusivity & Accessibility:** The mythos is for all, regardless of background or expertise.
- **Symbolic Modularity:** Every module is poetic, composable, and ethical — users traverse them narratively.
- **Onboarding First:** Identity is shaped through storytelling. No feature bypasses the user's internal journey.

## 2. The Initiation Journey: Your Entry into ThinkAlike

All who enter ThinkAlike—user, contributor, or guide—begin with the **Universal Portal Realm Initiation**. This is a sacred, narrative-driven journey, guided by Eos Lumina∴, that forges your unique presence in the mythos.

**Phases of Initiation (see [Portal Agent Integration](../../architecture/portal_agent_integration.md)):**
1. **The Threshold:** Encounter Eos Lumina∴ and receive the mythic context.
2. **The Mirror:** Reflect on your values, intentions, and resonance signature.
3. **The Glyph:** Forge your personal Initiation Glyph and Invocation Phrase—your symbolic key to the realms.
4. **The First Narrative Fork:** Choose your path. To become a contributor, select “Build ThinkAlike”—this unlocks the Co-Creation Journey.

*This initiation is a sacred prerequisite for all further engagement. Your journey is now mythically and technically recognized by the system.*
