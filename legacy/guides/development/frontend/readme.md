# Frontend Development Guides

## Purpose
This directory provides essential guides and best practices for frontend development within the ThinkAlike project, with a strong emphasis on creating accessible, inclusive, and high-quality user interfaces.

## Contents
```
.
├── accessibility_guide.md  # Comprehensive guide to WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and accessible React development.
└── readme.md               # This file.
```

## Key Files
- `accessibility_guide.md`: The canonical document for implementing accessibility in the project's frontend. It covers core principles (POUR), semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, ARIA standards, and testing methodologies. All frontend developers must adhere to this guide.

## Usage
Consult these guides during the design and implementation phases of any UI component or feature to ensure project standards are met.

## Dependencies
- This guide is tightly integrated with the project's core [Ethical Guidelines](../../../ethics/ethical_guidelines.md) and the overall [Visual Style Guide](../../style/visual_style_guide.md).

## Notes
Accessibility is a core value of the ThinkAlike project. These guides are not optional suggestions but required practice.
