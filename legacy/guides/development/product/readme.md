# Product Development Guides

## Purpose
This directory contains product management documents that define the features, user experiences, and requirements for the ThinkAlike platform. It serves as a bridge between the project's vision and its implementation.

## Contents
```
.
├── user_stories.md # Canonical user stories for different user roles and platform modes.
└── readme.md       # This file.
```

## Key Documents

- `user_stories.md`: This is the canonical collection of user stories for ThinkAlike. It outlines the needs and goals of different users—from new users discovering their narrative to developers building the platform—across all interaction modes. These stories are essential for guiding user-centered design and ensuring that development aligns with the project's ethical and functional goals.

## Usage
Product managers, designers, and developers should refer to these documents to understand the intended user experience and the specific requirements for features. The user stories provide the context needed to build a platform that is both powerful and aligned with user needs.

## Dependencies
- The user stories are closely linked to the [UI/UX Style Guide](../../style/ui_ux_style_guide.md), the [Ethical Guidelines](../../../ethics/ethical_guidelines.md), and the detailed feature specifications in `docs/features/`.
