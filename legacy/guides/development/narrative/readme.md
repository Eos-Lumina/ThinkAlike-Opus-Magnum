# Narrative Development Guides

## Purpose
This directory contains the guiding documents for ThinkAlike's "Co-Creation Journey," a ritualized, gamified narrative framework for project development. It provides the story, roles, and mechanics for making the process of building ThinkAlike an engaging and meaningful experience that reflects the project's core principles.

## Contents
```
.
├── gamified_narrative_guide.md # The core guide to the gamified development process.
├── chapters/                   # Contains the narrative chapters that frame development phases.
└── readme.md                   # This file.
```

## Key Documents

- `gamified_narrative_guide.md`: This is the central document explaining the entire narrative framework. It details the "Quest for Enlightenment 2.0," the different contributor roles (Lorekeeper, Architect, etc.), the ritualization mechanics like "Chrona Points" and "Resonance Badges," and how the narrative integrates with project management tools like the Swarm Roadmap.

- `chapters/`: This subdirectory contains the unfolding narrative of the development quest, with each chapter corresponding to a major project phase. These documents provide the story-based context and specific "Quests" for developers to embark upon.
  - `portal_to_resonance.md`: Chapter 1, focusing on the transition from user onboarding to the core matching and connection logic.
  - `runic_interfaces_and_vocal_rites.md`: Chapter 2, focusing on the development of the symbolic UI and voice interaction systems.

## Usage
All contributors, especially new ones, should start by reading the `gamified_narrative_guide.md` to understand the unique development culture of ThinkAlike. The `chapters` provide the specific narrative context for current development sprints.

## Dependencies
This framework is tightly integrated with the [Swarm Roadmap Operational Guide](../general/swarm_roadmap_operational_guide.md) and the project's overall `CONTRIBUTING.md` guidelines.
