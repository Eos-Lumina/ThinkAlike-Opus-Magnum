# Consent and Contradiction

**Status:** Relational Law Protocol
**Location:** `/docs/seed/laws/consent_and_contradiction.md`

## Purpose

All legal logic in ThinkAlike is rooted in two symbolic conditions:

- **Consent**: Affirmed participation in symbolic or relational acts
- **Contradiction**: A break in coherence, value alignment, or narrative structure

## Consent Types

- Temporal Consent (expires naturally)
- Ritual Consent (affirmed symbolically)
- Agent Consent (revocable, traceable)

## Contradiction Handling

- Frictionless surfacing
- Symbolic refactoring or divergence
- Reflection by swarm agents or Eos Lumina

No policing â€” only mirrored contradictions.
