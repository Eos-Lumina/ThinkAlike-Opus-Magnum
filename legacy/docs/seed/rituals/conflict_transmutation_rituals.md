# Conflict Transmutation Rituals

**Status:** Symbolic Mediation Framework
**Location:** `/docs/seed/rituals/conflict_transmutation_rituals.md`

## Purpose

Conflict in ThinkAlike is not suppressed — it is surfaced, framed, and **ritually transformed** into understanding or divergence.

## Ritual Pattern

1. **Trigger Glyph** — A symbol marks the tension
2. **Mirror Phase** — Agents or peers reflect competing values
3. **Mythic Reframing** — Conflict is translated into archetypal narrative
4. **Decision Fork** — Resolution or graceful divergence path invoked

## Types

- Fractal Undoing: retracting without punishment
- Mask Unveiling: identity-based misalignment healing
- Divergence Ritual: peaceful separation without rupture

All outcomes are logged as symbolic transformations — not “wins.”
