# Co-Creation Invocation

**Status:** Shared Action Entry Ritual
**Location:** `/docs/seed/rituals/co_creation_invocation.md`

## Purpose

All collaborative acts in ThinkAlike — proposals, documents, symbolic works — begin with an invocation. This ritual establishes intentionality, transparency, and epistemic clarity before the act of co-creation begins.

## Invocation Components

- Shared intention glyph (or phrase)
- Role anchoring: who is present, in what spirit
- Temporal marker: the “now” of initiation
- Commitment layer (ritual + revision ethics)

## Echo Phase

After invocation, agents or participants may:

- Reflect or modify initial frames
- Invoke shared mythic logic
- Declare revision pathways

This ritual embeds consent, clarity, and symbolic resonance into the act of making.
