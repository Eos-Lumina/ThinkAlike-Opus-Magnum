# System Seed: Design Notes

**Status:** Foundational Blueprint
**Location:** `/docs/seed/origins_of_emergence/system_seed_design_notes.md`

---

## Purpose

This document captures the original seed logic of ThinkAlike — its **structural DNA**.
Not a roadmap, but a **mycelial memory** of how the system began.

---

## Initial Conditions

- Systemic collapse of trust in platforms
- Need for symbolic, ritualized user engagement
- Desire for forkable identity + resonance-based interaction
- Refusal of algorithmic opacity and extractive AI

---

## Foundational Beliefs

- All data must be **ritualized or consented**
- All decisions must be **traceable and symbolic**
- All proposals must be **forkable and remembered**
- All users must enter through **narrative and myth**

## Core Design Seeds

| Layer              | Seed Principle                                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Onboarding         | Enter through myth, not form                    |
| Matching           | Resonance, not demographics                     |
| Governance         | Proposals are rituals, not votes                |
| Economy            | Time and care, not scarcity or fiat             |
| Agents             | Symbolic microservices, not black-box AI        |
| Memory             | Forked, poetic, ritual-bound                    |
| Identity           | Echoes, glyphs, and decisions — not profile data|
