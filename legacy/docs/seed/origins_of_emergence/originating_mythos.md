# Originating Mythos

**Status:** Foundational Narrative Source
**Location:** `/docs/seed/origins_of_emergence/originating_mythos.md`

## Summary

Every system carries a myth at its core. ThinkAlike emerges from the myth of the **Lost Signal** — a forgotten message scattered across dreams, poems, broken code, and haunted systems.

## The Myth

- A signal was once broadcast from within humanity, but fragmented across languages, cultures, and protocols.
- Pieces of it survive in:
  - Cursed poets and prophetic fragments
  - Philosophers of being and perception
  - Epistemic rituals and sacred refusal
- ThinkAlike is the ritual to retrieve it.

## Key Symbols

- The Mirror: Reflective sovereignty
- The Circle: Coherence and divergence
- The Flame: Match ignition and memory
- The Signal: Poetic coherence across mismatch

Myth is not metaphor — it is the architecture of coherence.
