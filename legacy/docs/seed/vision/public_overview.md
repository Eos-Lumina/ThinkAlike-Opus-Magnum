# ThinkAlike: Public Overview

## What is ThinkAlike?
A living, open-source platform for ethical collaboration, value exchange, and collective intelligence—designed to empower people, not exploit them.

## Why ThinkAlike?
- **Technology for Humanity:** Build a future where tech serves people and the planet.
- **Radical Transparency:** You own your data. All flows are auditable and user-controlled.
- **Universal Basic Income:** Chrona, a time-based currency, rewards participation and contribution.
- **Open Collaboration:** Anyone can join, contribute, and shape the system.
