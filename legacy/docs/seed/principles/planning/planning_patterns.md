# Planning Patterns

**Status:** Meta-Design Reference
**Location:** `/docs/seed/planning/planning_patterns.md`

## Overview

ThinkAlike does not follow fixed methodologies (Agile, Scrum, etc.). Instead, it evolves its own symbolic **planning grammars** — patterns adapted to different realms and rhythms.

## Patterns

- 🕊 Liminal Bloom — used in onboarding and narrative forks
- 🧭 Spiral Convergence — used in proposal co-creation
- 🔁 Fractal Rhythm — used in ritual calendar design
- 🌌 Slow Phase Drift — used in module deployments
- 🔮 Intent Invocation — used to initiate swarm-wide changes

## Use Case

These patterns are used by Eos Lumina and swarm agents to:

- Trigger design shifts
- Guide user decision flow
- Pace updates to symbolic systems
