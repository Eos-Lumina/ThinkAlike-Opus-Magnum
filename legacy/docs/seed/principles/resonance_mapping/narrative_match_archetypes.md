# Narrative Match Archetypes (Deprecated)

**Status:** Deprecated - Superseded by Archetypal Lens Matrix
**Location:** `docs/seed/resonance_mapping/narrative_match_archetypes.md`
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-08
**Reason for Deprecation:** The concepts and archetypes previously outlined in this document have been harmonized, expanded, and integrated into the canonical `docs/seed/symbolic_alignment/archetypal_lens_matrix.md`. Please refer to the Archetypal Lens Matrix for the current and definitive source on user archetypes within the ThinkAlike ecosystem.

## 1. Purpose (Historical)
Beyond direct value alignment or semantic similarity, a significant layer of user resonance within ThinkAlike is discovered through the mythic or narrative roles users embody or express. This system identifies and maps these Narrative Archetypes, which are often revealed through user interactions during the Portal Realm onboarding journey, particularly in their responses to symbolic prompts, dilemmas, and reflective choices.

These archetypes contribute to a richer understanding of potential compatibility and inform the matching logic within the Resonance Network by highlighting how users might interact, complement, or challenge each other in generative ways.

---

## 2. Core Narrative Archetypes (Historical)

The following are foundational archetypes identified within the ThinkAlike ecosystem. Users may embody a primary archetype and potentially express secondary ones. This list is not exhaustive and may evolve.

| Icon | Archetype   | Description & Typical Expression in ThinkAlike | Potential Match Behavior / Resonance Dynamics |
|------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| üî•   | The Catalyst | Seeks or embodies transformation, challenges existing norms, introduces disruptive yet potentially generative energy. | Resonates with Seekers needing direction, Guardians needing to adapt, or other Catalysts for amplified change. |
| üß≠   | The Seeker   | Driven by a quest for meaning, understanding, direction, or truth. Explores deeply and questions readily. | Resonates with Mirrors who reflect their seeking, Chroniclers who document their journey, or Guardians who offer stability. |
| üïäÔ∏è   | The Guardian | Protects core values, community integrity, tradition, or memory. Prioritizes stability, safety, and ethical continuity. | Resonates with Catalysts by providing grounding, Seekers by offering safe havens, or other Guardians for reinforcement. |
| üìú   | The Chronicler | Observes, reflects, narrates, and archives symbolic journeys, insights, and collective memory. Values history & story. | Resonates with Seekers whose journeys they document, Catalysts whose transformations they record, or Mirrors for insight. |
| üåÄ   | The Mirror   | Adapts to reflect and reveal the truths, potentials, or contradictions within others or situations. Highly empathetic. | Resonates strongly with Seekers by clarifying their path, or with any archetype by offering profound self-reflection. |
| üèóÔ∏è   | The Architect | Designs, builds, and refines systems, structures, or frameworks. Focuses on coherence, functionality, and order. | Resonates with Catalysts needing structure for their energy, or Guardians needing to build/maintain protective systems. |
| üåø   | The Weaver   | Focuses on interconnection, synthesis, and fostering relationships between disparate ideas, people, or elements. | Resonates across many archetypes by finding common threads and building bridges, particularly with Architects or Mirrors. |

These archetypes are inferred by the system (and contribute to a user's UserValueProfile / "Resonance Fingerprint") through:
- **Metaphor Use:** Language and symbols chosen in responses or the introductory video.
- **Decision Paths:** Choices made in ethical dilemmas or narrative forks during the Portal journey (e.g., "Seeds of Self" phase).
- **Tone and Pacing:** The style of expression in any textual or vocal input.
- **Responses to Symbolic Prompts:** How a user interacts with Eos Lumina's riddles or reflective questions.
- **(Future) Dream Motifs:** If dream_integration_rituals.md is implemented as a core input, recurring dream symbols could inform archetypal leanings.

## 3. Role in Matching & Resonance Logic

Narrative Archetypes are a key component of the "Symbolic Overlap" and "Narrative Synchrony" dimensions within the identity_resonance_score.md (IRS).

**Resonance Dynamics:**
- **Direct Alignment:** Users sharing the same primary archetype might find immediate understanding and shared purpose (e.g., two Seekers).
- **Complementary Resonance (Dyadic):** Certain archetypes naturally complement each other, creating a dynamic and generative connection (e.g., Mirror + Seeker; Catalyst + Architect).
- **Contrast Resonance (Dyadic):** Sometimes, contrasting archetypes can create a powerful, challenging, yet ultimately fruitful resonance if bridged by shared core values (e.g., a Catalyst pushing a Guardian to evolve, grounded by the Guardian's stability).
- **Triadic/Group Archetype Loops (Advanced):** For community formation (e.g., in Hives) or group Duets (future potential), combinations of three or more archetypes can create balanced and effective collective intelligence (e.g., a Seeker to find the way, an Architect to build it, and a Guardian to protect it).

**Informing Narrative Duets:**
- The AI Clone representing User B in a Narrative Duet may subtly exhibit traits or favor responses consistent with User B's dominant archetype(s).
- The thematic content or challenges within a Duet might be subtly tailored to explore the interplay between User A's and User B's archetypes.

**Use Cases:**
- Eos Lumina‚à¥ uses inferred archetypal alignment (as part of the IRS) to identify users with high symbolic coherence for potential Narrative Duets, especially during the Portal Realm's "Whispering Gallery" phase.
- Archetypes are primarily identified and weighted during the Portal onboarding journey (specifically in the "Seeds of Self" phase and through ongoing narrative choices).
- They are a significant input to the identity_resonance_score.md and contribute to the patterns within symbolic_resonance_fields.md.

## 4. Design & System Integration

The influence of these Narrative Archetypes extends beyond matching logic:
- **UI Theming (Subtle):** A user's dominant archetype might subtly influence minor thematic elements or glyphs within their personalized views or aspects of their User Node's aura (if auras are implemented).
- **Content Personalization (Portal):** Eos Lumina‚à¥ might subtly adjust her phrasing or the types of symbolic examples she uses based on the user's emerging archetypal leanings to enhance engagement.
- **(Future) Dream Mapping Overlays:** If dream integration is implemented, shared archetypal themes found in dreams could be visualized as overlays on the Resonance Network map.
- **(Future) Proposal Clustering in Hives:** Proposals in Community Hives might be tagged or naturally cluster based on the archetypal energies they embody (e.g., a "Catalyst" proposal for radical change vs. a "Guardian" proposal for preservation).
