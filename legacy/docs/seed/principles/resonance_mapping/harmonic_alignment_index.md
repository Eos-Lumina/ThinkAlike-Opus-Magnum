## Overview

The **Harmonic Alignment Index (HAI)** is a macro-level resonance indicator used to evaluate the **alignment potential of groups, systems, or collectives**. While the Identity Resonance Score (IRS) measures individual-to-individual compatibility, HAI extends this logic to **collective dynamics**, enabling real-time diagnostics of organizational coherence, collaborative readiness, and systemic synergy.

---

## Function

HAI reflects the **frequency coherence** of a collective, network, or temporary working group. It detects and quantifies the **field-level harmony** — the emergent alignment across values, symbols, intentions, and epistemic orientations.

It is used to answer questions like:

- Is this group ready to co-create without collapsing into conflict or entropy?
- How aligned is this council, swarm, DAO, or movement on deep symbolic and ethical levels?
- Can this constellation of agents achieve **constructive emergence**?

## Core Dimensions

| Dimension                  | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Symbolic Resonance**     | Degree of archetypal and narrative congruence. |
| **Value Mesh Density**     | Overlap and compatibility of declared value profiles across nodes. |
| **Cognitive Diversity Index** | Balance between epistemic variety and mutual comprehensibility. |
| **Rhythmic Cohesion**      | Degree of communicative and temporal synchronicity in discourse and action. |
| **Fractal Compatibility**  | Recurring alignment patterns across multiple scales (micro to macro). |
| **Trust Entanglement Score** | Degree of mutual validation, reputation flow, and relational integrity within the group. |

---

## Scoring Ranges

| HAI Score Range | Interpretation |
|-----------------|----------------|
| 90–100          | High coherence — optimal alignment for emergence and co-creation. |
| 70–89           | Strong potential — some divergence, but manageable through facilitation. |
| 50–69           | Caution — ideological friction, symbolic misalignment, or value incoherence. |
| <50             | Misalignment — group is likely to fracture or encounter blockages. Requires recalibration or mediation. |

## Computational Design

HAI is calculated via a dynamic graph traversal algorithm which:

1. Builds a **symbolic-cognitive resonance graph** across users and nodes.
2. Weighs each edge by IRS, communicative rhythm, and shared epistemic references.
3. Runs **wavelet transform analysis** on symbolic vectors to detect phase interference or coherence.
4. Integrates **temporal modulation coefficients** based on real-time events and ritual alignment.

HAI is recalculated **episodically** during high-resonance events (e.g., community votes, shared initiations, collaborative thresholds).

---

## Applications

- **Hive Governance Diagnostics:** Evaluate whether a DAO or swarm is ready to reach quorum or make critical decisions.
- **Community Health Metrics:** Detect misalignments before conflict emerges.
- **Ritual Synchronization:** Time initiations or symbolic activations when HAI is optimal.
- **Group Formation Engine:** Suggest optimal team compositions based on potential harmonic synergies.

---

## Philosophical Foundation

HAI assumes that **emergence is rhythmic**, and alignment is not just a state — it is a **field phenomenon**. It draws from musical harmony, process philosophy, and network theory, asserting that **relational integrity** and symbolic consonance are precursors to systemic intelligence.
