# Semantic Overlay Modes

**Status:** Narrative-Driven UI Grammar
**Location:** `/docs/seed/overlays/semantic_overlay_modes.md`

## Purpose

This file defines how ThinkAlike adapts its semantic layer — including language, tone, iconography, and interaction prompts — based on the user’s symbolic alignment and current system layer.

---

## Modes

- **Mirror Mode**: Reflective language, pause loops, subtle glyphs
- **Match Mode**: Identity-rich language, energetic metaphor, narrative prompts
- **Proposal Mode**: Ritual tone, slow pacing, explicit symbology
- **Dream Mode**: Poetic ambiguity, symbolic resonance trails, floating overlays
- **Crisis Mode**: Minimal UI, grounding anchors, swarm intervention prompts

---

## Technical Integration

Each overlay mode is loaded by the `narrative_engine` and interpreted by agent context.

Agents (e.g., Eos, Kairos) modify their language and pacing accordingly.

UI is not static.
It **resonates**.
