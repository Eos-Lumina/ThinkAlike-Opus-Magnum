# Blockchain & Chrona Wallet Integration Guide

This document provides technical and conceptual guidance for integrating blockchain and Chrona wallet features into ThinkAlike.

## Purpose
- Help developers understand how wallet and blockchain modules interact with the roadmap and swarming features.
- Document integration patterns, security considerations, and extensibility options.

## Chrona Wallet
- Used for identity, value transactions, and rewards.
- API endpoints for deposit, withdraw, simulate, and transaction history.
- UI components for onboarding and transaction feedback.

## Blockchain Integration
- Optional: Record wallet transactions on a blockchain for auditability and transparency.
- `blockchain.py` provides hooks for transaction recording and status checks.
- Security: Ensure privacy, integrity, and compliance with project protocols.

## Integration Patterns
- Roadmap achievements trigger Chrona wallet transactions.
- Swarming actions can be logged and rewarded via wallet and blockchain.
- Agents can initiate or moderate blockchain-backed quests.

## Extensibility
- Support for multiple blockchains or distributed ledgers.
- Modular design for future upgrades and protocol changes.

## Developer Notes
- Reference simulation protocol and UI/UX guidelines.
- Document all integration points and keep modules loosely coupled.
