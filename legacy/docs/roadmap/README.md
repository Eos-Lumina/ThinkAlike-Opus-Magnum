# Gamified Dynamic Roadmap Overview

This document describes the vision, structure, and integration points for the ThinkAlike gamified roadmap, swarming, Chrona wallet rewards, and agent participation.

## Purpose
- Guide developers in building a collaborative, quest-driven roadmap.
- Integrate Chrona wallet for rewards and progress tracking.
- Enable swarming (collaborative quests) and agent guidance (Eos Lumina, etc.).

## Key Concepts
- **Quests/Tasks:** Roadmap items users can complete solo or in swarms.
- **Swarming:** Users form groups to tackle collaborative challenges.
- **Chrona Rewards:** Progress and achievements earn Chrona, distributed via wallet integration.
- **Agent Integration:** Agents guide, moderate, and generate dynamic quests.

## Directory Structure
- `src/roadmap/`: Roadmap logic and game mechanics.
- `src/roadmap/ui/`: UI components for roadmap visualization and quest management.
- `src/roadmap/agents/`: Agent logic for roadmap participation.
- `src/roadmap/integration/`: Chrona wallet, swarming, and agent APIs.

## Integration Points
- Chrona wallet API for rewards and transactions.
- Swarming logic for collaborative quest completion.
- Agent APIs for guidance and dynamic quest generation.

## Next Steps
- Scaffold roadmap modules and UI.
- Define agent roles and swarming protocols.
- Integrate Chrona wallet and blockchain as needed.
