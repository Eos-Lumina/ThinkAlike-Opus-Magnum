# Agent Integration in Gamified Roadmap

This document explains how agents (e.g., Eos Lumina) participate in and enhance the gamified roadmap experience.

## Purpose
- Guide developers in implementing agent-driven quests, feedback, and swarming facilitation.

## Agent Roles
- **Guide:** Offer onboarding, hints, and feedback to users.
- **Moderator:** Oversee collaborative quests and resolve conflicts.
- **Quest Generator:** Create dynamic, personalized quests for individuals and swarms.

## Integration Points
- Agents interact with roadmap UI and backend via APIs.
- Agents can trigger Chrona wallet rewards and blockchain transactions.
- Swarming protocols allow agents to facilitate group formation and quest assignment.

## Developer Notes
- Design agent APIs to be extensible and support multiple agent types.
- Ensure agents follow project protocols and ethical guidelines.
