# Swarming Protocols for Roadmap Collaboration

This document outlines the protocols and mechanics for swarming (collaborative quests) in the ThinkAlike roadmap.

## Purpose
- Enable users to form swarms and complete quests together.
- Integrate Chrona wallet rewards and agent facilitation.

## Swarming Mechanics
- Users can join or create swarms for specific quests.
- Progress and achievements are tracked for individuals and groups.
- Chrona rewards are distributed based on contribution and completion.

## Integration Points
- Swarming actions trigger wallet transactions and can be logged on the blockchain.
- Agents facilitate swarm formation, quest assignment, and conflict resolution.

## Developer Notes
- Design swarming APIs to be modular and extensible.
- Ensure fair reward distribution and transparent progress tracking.
