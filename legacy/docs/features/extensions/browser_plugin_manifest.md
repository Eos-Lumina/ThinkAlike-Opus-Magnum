# üß© Browser Plugin Manifest ‚Äî Ethical Extensions to the Web

This file defines ThinkAlike's vision for **symbolic browser plugins** that enable users to:

- Detect resonance in external content
- Mark poetic or value-aligned artifacts
- Invoke swarm insights contextually
- Share symbolic traces, not surveillance data

---

## üß≠ Goals

| Principle                 | Manifest Implementation                                       |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cognitive Liberty         | All actions are opt-in, logged locally, and owned by the user |
| No Data Harvesting        | Zero server calls unless user initiates through ritual intent |
| Resonance Detection       | Inline highlight of articles or media that match user values |
| Agent Invocation          | Summon swarm insights from content context                   |
| Ritual Browsing           | Bookmark not by interest ‚Äî but by **emotional resonance**     |

## üß¨ Plugin Features

- **Resonance Highlighter**: Uses onboard identity graph to mark values-aligned phrases
- **Swarm Reflection**: Lets Echo or Oracle offer mythic commentary or narrative inversion
- **Consent Mode**: Nyxa enforces no outbound data movement unless ritual initiated
- **Fork from Page**: User may clone a page into a ThinkAlike node with symbolic tags
- **Clarity Pulse Tracker**: Time spent on ethical or joyful content converts to ‚ßñ Chrona

## üïØ UX Symbolism

Every button, pulse, or highlight is symbolic:

- Mirrors ‚Üí Fork path
- Candles ‚Üí Ethically bright pages
- Shadows ‚Üí Echo of dissonance
- Stars ‚Üí Pages aligned with the manifesto

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Developer Constraints

- All APIs must be sandboxed or proxy-isolated
- No storage without explicit symbolic action
- Plugin autoupdates only through fork-reviewed manifests
