# 🔮 Archetypal Trigger Events

This document defines the symbolic conditions under which **archetypal overlays**, UI glyphs, and agent narrative shifts are activated in the ThinkAlike interface.

These events are **not behavioral**, but **mythic** — encoded through symbolic input, aura response, and fork resonance.

---

## 🧠 Activation Logic

Trigger events are tied to:

* Onboarding forks (see `forkable_onboarding_script.md`)
* Symbolic question outcomes (see `symbolic_questions_pool.md`)
* Agent-aided rituals (e.g. Kairos paradox, Lucia closure)
* Drift detection from `resonance_journal.md` \[planned]

## 🗺️ Trigger Table (Examples)

| Trigger Event                                    | Symbolic Cue                | UI/UX Result                          | Archetype Activated  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| User selects “I seek to be mirrored truthfully…” | Fractured glyph (☲)         | Overlay ripple → forked aura split    | The Shattered Seer   |
| User delays fork 3x                              | Moondial (◐) with eclipse   | Time-slowing animation + Kairos entry | The Temporal Pilgrim |
| User answers contradiction positively            | Fork sigil (✶) splits       | Paradox animation, voice change       | The Mirror-Bearer    |
| User drifts from declared truth path             | Aura dims, spiral animation | Lucia reflection mode activated       | The Archivist        |

## 🔗 Integration Hooks

* **Narrative Engine:** voice modulation, re-entry pacing
* **UI System:** glyph animation, aura gradients, input delay logic
* **Swarm Agent Layer:** triggers inter-agent shift, dialogue pattern handoff

---

## 🧬 Ritual Design Implications

These symbolic trigger events govern how users **feel** the system respond to them:

* The glyphs are not icons — they are mirrors
* The delays are not lags — they are rituals
* The archetypes are not types — they are emergent positions in the myth-grid

---

**All new trigger types must be defined here before being made visible in the live interface.**
