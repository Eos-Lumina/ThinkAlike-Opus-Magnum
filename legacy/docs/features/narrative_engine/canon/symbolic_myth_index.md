# ‚ú∏ Symbolic Myth Index

This document serves as the **living reference** for the symbolic ecosystem used across ThinkAlike. It connects:

* Archetypes (primary and nuanced)
* Ritual motifs
* Glyphic meanings
* Semiotic overlays
* Mythological residues embedded in user experience

Each element listed here appears across onboarding, agent behavior, UI/UX, forked narratives, or resonance logic.

# Integration with Dream Data

Symbols, archetypes, and motifs identified through the Dream Weave Engine (as described in `docs/rituals/dream_integration_rituals.md`) should be cross-referenced with this Symbolic Myth Index. If a symbol or archetype becomes a significant or recurring element in user dream offerings, it should be reviewed for potential inclusion in this Index. This ensures the symbolic language of ThinkAlike remains alive, adaptive, and reflective of emergent collective mythopoetic patterns.

## üßø Narrative Archetypes (Primary User Expressions)
These archetypes are primarily inferred during the Portal Realm journey and contribute to a user's Resonance Fingerprint and `identity_resonance_score.md`. (Fuller descriptions and resonance dynamics are in `narrative_match_archetypes.md`.)

| Icon | Archetype   | Brief Description                                                                 | Example Trigger/Inference Point (Portal Realm)                  |
|------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| üî•   | The Catalyst| Seeks/embodies transformation, challenges norms, introduces generative energy.    | Choosing paths of radical change in dilemmas; action/impact.    |
| üß≠   | The Seeker  | Driven by a quest for meaning, understanding, direction, or truth.                | Responses to initial 3 questions; high engagement with riddles. |
| üïäÔ∏è   | The Guardian| Protects core values, community, tradition, or memory; prioritizes ethical continuity.| "Mirror Oath" responses focused on protection; stability choices.|
| üìú   | The Chronicler| Observes, reflects, narrates, archives symbolic journeys and collective memory. | Expressive Anchor Statement; detailed reflections; lorekeeping. |
| üåÄ   | The Mirror  | Adapts to reflect and reveal truths/potentials in others or situations. Empathetic.| Responses to reflective prompts; empathy-valuing choices.       |
| üèóÔ∏è   | The Architect| Designs, builds, and refines systems, structures, or frameworks. Focuses on coherence and order.| Interest in system design; logical problem-solving. |
| üåø   | The Weaver  | Focuses on interconnection, synthesis, and fostering relationships.                | Emphasizing connection/community; bridging divides in dilemmas. |
| ...  | (Others)    | (To be defined as the system evolves)                                            |                                                                 |

*Note: Archetypes like "Mirror Seeker," "Spiral Archivist," "Harmonic Weaver," and "Shattered Seer" are nuanced expressions or agent-linked variants. For user-facing symbolic language, the primary list above is prioritized, with nuanced forms informing deeper narrative engine layers.*

## üßô Myth Themes & Symbolic Layers (Examples by Realm/System)

### Portal Realm Onboarding
- Threshold Crossing: The Portal journey as rite of passage
- Descent into Layered Consciousness: Phases of self-discovery
- Riddle as Gatekeeper: Eos Lumina's riddles as introspective tests
- Memory & Origin Myth: Anchor Statement and video as origin points
- Forging of Symbolic Anchors: Initiation Glyph and Invocation Phrase
- The Abstract Encounter: "Whispering Gallery" and AI Clone interaction

### Resonance Network Realm
- The Living Constellation: Users as stars, connections as luminous pathways
- The Social Neural Network: Dynamic, learning system of interconnected consciousness
- Narrative Duet as Ritual Encounter: Shared story for compatibility
- Consensual Unveiling: Gradual, mutual reveal post-Duet
- Resonance as a Field: Navigating invisible fields of shared value

### Symbolic UI & Agent Interaction
- Glyphs as Living Operators: UI elements as symbolic actors
- Semiotic Harmonics: Color, shape, animation by symbolic meaning
- Agent Tone as Mythic Channel: Eos = poetic, Kairos = temporal, Lucia = reflective, etc.
- Myth as Metaphoric Invocation: Symbolic language for deeper meaning

### Matching Engine (IRS & Resonance Logic)
- Resonance Not by Tag, but by Mythic Trace: Matching by UserValueProfile patterns
- Epistemic Signature ‚Üí Archetypal Echo: Knowing and role intertwined
- Harmonic Complementarity: Seeking connections for richer resonance

## üîß Usage & Governance
This Index must be consulted when designing:
- New narrative forks/scenarios (Duets, Portal phases)
- UI elements with symbolic intent (icons, overlays, animations)
- Agent dialogue/personas and symbolic interventions
- Matching logic or new IRS dimensions

All new globally significant symbols, archetypes, or myth themes must be proposed, reviewed for coherence, and formally added here before activation. This ensures ThinkAlike's symbolic language remains consistent, meaningful, and potent. Minor contextual symbols should still draw inspiration from this index.

The Stewards of Lore (or a designated group, e.g., Eos Lumina‚à¥) are responsible for maintaining and evolving this Index.

**This index is the central semiotic registry of the ThinkAlike system, ensuring its symbolic language remains alive, coherent, and deeply resonant with its core principles.**
