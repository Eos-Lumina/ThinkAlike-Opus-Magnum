### Chrona Transaction Lifecycle

This diagram illustrates the complete lifecycle of a Chrona transaction, from earning to settlement and the resulting feedback loop that influences the system's economy and reputation layers.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Contribution & Earning"
        A["Contributor performs valuable action (Service, Creation, Stewardship)"] --> B["Chrona earned based on action's value"]
        B --> C["TimeSteward Rank adjusted based on contribution"]
    end

    subgraph "Transaction & Verification"
        D["Chrona stored in Contributor's Wallet"] --> E["Transaction Initiated (e.g., value exchange)"]
        E --> F["Resonance Engine verifies alignment & purpose"]
    end

    subgraph "Settlement & Impact"
        F -- "Verification OK" --> G["Chrona transferred to Recipient's Wallet"]
        G --> H["Recipient's reputation is enhanced"]
        H --> I["Transaction and feedback recorded in Chrona Ledger & Hive Graph"]
    end

    %% The feedback loop
    I --> C
