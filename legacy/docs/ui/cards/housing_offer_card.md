## ‚ö≠ OVERVIEW
The HousingOfferCard is the canonical UI element for presenting housing offers in the ThinkAlike Housing Realm. It embodies ethical, community-oriented discovery, resonance-based matching, and ritualized trust-building. The card is designed to:
- Present all essential details for resonance and ethical decision-making.
- Visually communicate trust, accessibility, and symbolic/ritual context.
- Support PET/Clarity, non-extractive principles, and accessibility at every layer.
- Serve as the primary element in housing discovery, search, onboarding, and ritual flows.

## üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è VISUAL RESONANCE & STATES
- **Visual Embodiment:** Built on Card.md, with specialized sections for location, type, exchange, values, trust glyphs, and symbolic overlays.
- **Color Harmonics & Typography:**
  - Dark theme base, orange/blue/gold accent palette (see canonical_visual_style_guide.md).
  - Montserrat (headings), Open Sans (body).
  - Trust glyphs: Gold accent (#FFD700) for verified/trusted, blue (#1E90FF) for feedback, orange (#FF9500) for new/ritual status.
  - Accessibility tags: Blue (#1E90FF) with white text for high contrast.
  - Resonance indicators: Glowing border in ThinkAlike Orange (#FF9500) when a strong match is detected.
  - Chrona, barter, and gift terms use distinct color chips/icons with PET/Clarity tooltips.
- **Symbolic Overlays:**
  - Onboarding status: Animated ‚Äúkey‚Äù glyph in the top-right, glowing when onboarding is complete.
  - Housewarming glyph: Stylized ‚Äúhearth‚Äù icon appears when a new resident is welcomed.
  - Consent matrix: Overlay banner or icon cluster, clickable for details.
  - Resonance match: Glowing border and resonance glyph.
- **States:**
  - Default: All info visible, overlays present if relevant.
  - Hover: Card shadow intensifies, border color shifts to accent (orange for resonance, gold for trust).
  - Focus: Outline appears in blue, with subtle animation for accessibility.
  - Pending Confirmation: Card dims, ‚Äúawaiting response‚Äù overlay.

## üß≠ USAGE PROTOCOLS & ACCESSIBILITY
- **Usage:**
  - Used in housing discovery grids, search results, and onboarding flows.
  - May be embedded in profile views or project/Hive dashboards.
- **Accessibility:**
  - ARIA role: `article` with `aria-labelledby` for title.
  - All images, icons, and overlays have descriptive alt text and ARIA labels.
  - Keyboard navigation: All interactive elements (buttons, overlays, consent matrix) are tab-accessible, with logical tab order and visible focus states.
  - Trust glyphs and symbolic overlays use `aria-describedby` for detailed descriptions (e.g.,
    `<span aria-label="Trust Glyph: Verified Host" aria-describedby="trust-desc-1"></span>`
    `<span id="trust-desc-1" hidden>This host has been verified by the community and received 5-star feedback.</span>`
  - All data points are clearly labeled; color is never the sole means of conveying information.
  - WCAG AAA compliance targeted.

## ‚öñÔ∏è ETHICAL ALIGNMENT & PET (Privacy, Ethics, Transparency)
- **Privacy/Consent:**
  - Sensitive details (exact address, contact) are masked by default and revealed only after mutual consent or match.
  - ConsentMatrixOverlay visually indicates which info is shared and under what conditions; clicking opens a modal or tooltip summarizing info sharing (e.g., ‚ÄúYour contact info will only be revealed after mutual consent.‚Äù).
- **Transparency:**
  - All exchange terms, house rules, and governance are explicit and visually clear, with PET/Clarity tooltips for each exchange chip.
- **Non-Extractive Principle:**
  - Exchange terms are shown as ‚Äúchips‚Äù with PET/Clarity tooltips explaining the meaning (e.g., ‚ÄúChrona: time-backed, non-monetary exchange‚Äù).
  - No pricing or terms that violate ThinkAlike's non-extractive ethos; all offers are reviewed for compliance.

---

## ‚ú® SYMBOLIC RESONANCE & RITUAL INTEGRATION
- **Ritual of Offering/Seeking Shelter:**
  - Card visually encodes the act of offering shelter as a ritual gesture (e.g., animated ‚Äúkey‚Äù glyph, housewarming ‚Äúhearth‚Äù icon).
- **Trust Glyphs & Value Alignment:**
  - Trust glyphs, value tags, and linked Hives reinforce resonance and shared purpose.
- **Ritual Flows:**
  - When a match is made, the card animates a ‚Äúkey‚Äù glyph and displays a message: ‚ÄúWelcome ritual initiated. Awaiting host response.‚Äù
