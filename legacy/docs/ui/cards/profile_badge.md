# üõ°Ô∏è PROFILE BADGE
<small>"Trust, earned and seen."</small>

## ‚ö≠ OVERVIEW & PURPOSE
The ProfileBadge is a symbolic, PET/Clarity-aligned UI element for displaying user trust, reputation, and key profile attributes. It is used throughout ThinkAlike to visually communicate DID-bound reputation, feedback, and symbolic status in a compact, accessible format. The badge is foundational for building trust and conveying key attributes at a glance in ProfileCard, CommunityProfileDisplay, HousingOfferCard, and HousingNeedCard.

## üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è VISUAL & SYMBOLIC GUIDELINES
- **Shape & Structure:** Circular or shield-shaped badge, with layered glyphs for trust, feedback, and symbolic status. Only one primary badge/glyph is shown at a time; if multiple, consider a ProfileBadgeGroup or cycle/aggregate visually.
- **Color Harmonics:**
  - Gold (#FFD700) for verified/trusted
  - Blue (#1E90FF) for feedback
  - Orange (#FF9500) for new/ritual status
  - **Error Red (#FF4136)** for warnings or revoked trust
- **Symbolic Overlays/Glyphs:**
  - **Trust:** Checkmark (‚úîÔ∏è), star (‚≠ê), handshake (ü§ù), flame (üî• for ritual)
  - **Feedback:** Numeric score or count as a sub-badge, ring, or small overlay (e.g., 4.5‚òÖ, or a blue ring with the number inside)
  - **PET/Clarity:** Optional overlays for privacy/consent (lock üîí, eye üëÅÔ∏è, shield üõ°Ô∏è) if badge represents profile visibility status
- **States:**
  - **Default:** All glyphs and overlays visible, high contrast
  - **Hover/Focus:** Badge slightly enlarges, border glows in accent color
  - **Error/Revoked:** Badge dims, Error Red border/accent, tooltip explains status
- **Accessibility:** ARIA role `img` with comprehensive `aria-label` (e.g., "Profile Trust Status: Verified. Community Feedback: 4.5 average. Active Ritual Participant."). Color is never the sole indicator; glyphs and text reinforce meaning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è FUNCTIONAL CORE & INTERACTION DYNAMICS (PROPS)
| Name           | Type                | Required | Description |
|----------------|---------------------|----------|-------------|
| did / userId   | string              | Yes      | Decentralized identifier for the user. |
| trustLevel     | 'verified' | 'trusted' | 'new' | 'revoked' | 'pending_verification' | Yes | Trust status, affects glyph and color. |
| feedbackScore  | number              | No       | Aggregate feedback or rating (e.g., 4.5). |
| feedbackCount  | number              | No       | Number of feedback entries. |
| badge          | BadgeDetail         | No       | Primary symbolic badge (e.g., host, mentor, ritual participant). |
| petStatus      | 'private' | 'public' | 'consent-required' | No | PET/Clarity overlay status. |
| onClick        | function            | No       | Handler for badge click (e.g., show profile details or tooltip). |

**BadgeDetail interface:**
```ts
interface BadgeDetail {
  label: string;
  glyph: string; // Unicode or SVG glyph
  description?: string;
}
```

## üß≠ USAGE PROTOCOLS & ACCESSIBILITY
- Used in profile cards, community member lists, onboarding flows, and housing cards.
- ARIA role: `img` with `aria-label` describing trust level, feedback, and badge.
- Tooltip or modal with full badge details on click or focus.
- Color is never the sole means of conveying trust or status; glyphs and text are always present.
- Error/warning states are announced to screen readers.
- WCAG AAA compliance targeted.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è PET/CLARITY & SYMBOLIC PROTOCOLS
- **Transparency:** All trust/status indicators are clear, with tooltips explaining their meaning. Trust is earned, not bought.
- **Non-Extractive:** Badges and trust levels are earned through community participation, not payment or extraction.
- **Symbolic:** Each glyph and color is meaningful and explained in a legend or tooltip.
