# ðŸ§© Modular UI Specification

This document defines ThinkAlikeâ€™s front-end component system and layout logic. It allows interface views to be swapped, extended, or forked.

---

## ðŸ§± UI Patterns

- Component-based layout (inspired by shadcn/ui and Tailwind)  
- Grid logic built on onboarding arcs and resonance overlays  
- All views forkable â€” narrative logic reflects in design logic  
- Supports right-to-left, high contrast, and TTS modes

---

## ðŸ§  Primary View Types

- `identity_onboarding_view`  
- `resonance_match_preview`  
- `module_card_overview`  
- `contributor_certification_path`  
- `task_fork_timeline`

---

## ðŸ§© UI Logic Integration

- Each component must log metadata via `data_traceability_module.md`  
- Must work with agent overlay feedback systems  
- Style driven by `style_guidelines.md`
