# Voice-Guided Onboarding System Design

## Overview
This document describes the vision, technical requirements, and developer guidance for building a voice-guided onboarding system in ThinkAlike, centered on the Eos Lumina∴ agent and the project's ritual/narrative UX.

## Goals
- Provide a welcoming, accessible, and ritualized onboarding experience for all users.
- Use Eos Lumina∴'s synthesized voice as the primary guide, mentor, and narrator.
- Integrate voice synthesis, emotion mapping, and symbolic UX for onboarding flows.
- Ensure accessibility and fallback for hearing-impaired users.

## Key Features
- Voice synthesis pipeline (see `voice_synthesis_design.md`)
- Emotion mapping for dynamic, context-aware narration
- Real-time voice generation and prompt delivery
- Ritualized onboarding steps (e.g., Initiation Glyph, Invocation Phrase)
- Data traceability and user control

## Technical Architecture
- **Voice Synthesis Module:** Neural TTS model (e.g., ElevenLabs) with post-processing for Eos Lumina∴'s unique sound.
- **Onboarding Flow Engine:** Orchestrates onboarding steps, voice prompts, and user responses.
- **Emotion Mapper:** Modulates voice parameters based on onboarding context and user state.
- **Accessibility Layer:** Provides alternative onboarding for hearing-impaired users.
- **Agent API:** Eos Lumina∴ agent logic for guidance, feedback, and narrative voice.

## Developer Guidance
- Reference `voice_synthesis_design.md` for voice character and technical requirements.
- Design onboarding flows as modular, extensible steps with clear voice prompts.
- Integrate emotion mapping and accessibility from the start.
- Document all APIs, data structures, and UX flows for future extension.

## Next Steps
- Scaffold onboarding modules in `src/onboarding/` and `src/voice/`.
- Implement voice synthesis and onboarding flow logic.
- Test with real users and iterate for clarity, accessibility, and engagement.
