# Matching Algorithms Overview

This document describes matching algorithms for resonance, value alignment, agent pairing, and quest assignment in ThinkAlike, with explicit integration of the Value Profile system.

## Purpose
- Match users to quests, swarms, and opportunities using the Value Profile system, resonance scores, and contribution metrics.
- Support roadmap, agent, and economic modules with value-driven matching.

## Key Concepts
- Value Profile system: Each user has a dynamic profile representing their values, preferences, and behavioral patterns.
- Resonance scoring: Algorithms compute resonance between user profiles and available quests, swarms, or agents.
- Value alignment: Matching logic prioritizes opportunities that align with user values and collective goals.
- Agent-user matching: Agents are paired with users based on profile compatibility and narrative needs.
- Quest assignment: Quests are recommended based on profile resonance and contribution history.

## Next Steps
- Design and implement matching algorithms in `src/algorithms/` that:
    - Ingest and process Value Profile data for each user.
    - Calculate resonance and alignment scores for matching.
    - Integrate with roadmap, wallet, and agent modules.
- Document integration points and provide API/data structure examples for Value Profile usage.
