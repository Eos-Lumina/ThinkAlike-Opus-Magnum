# Governance Algorithms Overview

This document describes algorithms for voting, consensus, and protocol retirement in ThinkAlike.

## Purpose
- Enable participatory, transparent governance processes.
- Support sunset ceremonies, voting, and consensus mechanisms.

## Key Concepts
- Voting logic
- Consensus algorithms
- Protocol retirement (sunset ceremonies)

## Next Steps
- Design and implement governance algorithms in `src/algorithms/`.
- Document integration points with roadmap and economic modules.
