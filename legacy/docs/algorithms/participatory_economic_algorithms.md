# Participatory Economic Algorithms Overview

This document outlines the vision and requirements for participatory economic algorithms in ThinkAlike.

## Purpose
- Enable fair, transparent, and collaborative value distribution.
- Support Chrona wallet, swarming, and roadmap reward logic.
- Align with ethical and ritual protocols.

## Key Concepts
- **Value Matching:** Algorithms for matching users to quests, swarms, and opportunities based on resonance and contribution.
- **Reward Distribution:** Logic for distributing Chrona and other rewards based on participation, achievement, and governance votes.
- **Economic Governance:** Algorithms for voting, consensus, and protocol retirement (e.g., sunset ceremonies).
- **Transparency & Auditability:** All economic flows are logged, auditable, and open to review.

## Next Steps
- Design and implement matching, reward, and governance algorithms in `src/algorithms/`.
- Document integration points with wallet, roadmap, and agent modules.
- Ensure compliance with ethical safeguards and ritual protocols.
