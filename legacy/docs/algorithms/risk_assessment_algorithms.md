# Risk Assessment Algorithms Overview

This document describes algorithms for ethical red-teaming, horizon scanning, and feedback loop detection in ThinkAlike.

## Purpose
- Identify and mitigate manipulation vectors, data misuse, and emergent ethical risks.
- Support Lapis Oracle integration and dynamic risk assessment.

## Key Concepts
- Ethical red-teaming
- Horizon scanning
- Feedback loop detection

## Next Steps
- Design and implement risk assessment algorithms in `src/algorithms/`.
- Document integration points with agent and governance modules.
