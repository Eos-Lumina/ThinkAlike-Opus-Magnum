# Simplified Documentation Structure (Seed-Only)

All living, canonical documentation should reside in `docs/seed/`.

## docs/
- seed/
    - core/
    - meta/
    - identity_protocol/
    - noetica/
    - resonance_mapping/
    - symbolic_alignment/
    - ... (all other essential docs)
- archive_legacy/
    - [deprecated or superseded docs]

## Migration Checklist (Preserve Seed)
- [ ] Leave `docs/seed/` and its subfolders unchanged.
- [ ] Review all other documentation folders (e.g., `architecture/`, `modules/`, `protocols/`, `agents/`, etc.).
- [ ] Move any essential, non-seed docs to appropriate locations (or keep in place if justified).
- [ ] Move deprecated, legacy, or redundant docs to `docs/archive_legacy/`.
- [ ] Remove or merge redundant folders after migration.
- [ ] Ensure all indices and manifests reference the new, simplified structure.
- [ ] Confirm that `docs/seed/` remains the core, living documentation hub.

> This keeps your living docs stable while cleaning up and future-proofing the rest of the documentation system.
