# Portal Realm Coherence Sprint Plan

**Sprint Duration:** 2025-06-06 to 2025-06-20
**Objective:** Deeply review, harmonize, and cross-link all Portal Realm documentation to ensure a seamless, consistent onboarding gateway into ThinkAlike.

## Scope
- Core docs: [`portal_specification.md`](../realms/portal/portal_specification.md)
- Narrative paths: [`forkable_onboarding_script.md`](../realms/portal/forkable_onboarding_script.md), [`symbolic_questions_pool.md`](../realms/portal/symbolic_questions_pool.md), [`ritual_fork_archive.md`](../realms/portal/ritual_fork_archive.md), [`resonance_onboarding_variants.md`](../realms/portal/resonance_onboarding_variants.md), [`voice_guided_onboarding.md`](../realms/portal/voice_guided_onboarding.md), [`eos_lumina_riddle_pool.md`](../realms/portal/eos_lumina_riddle_pool.md)
- Persona files: Eos Lumina agent persona docs and integration guides
- Style & system references: UI/UX Style Guide, Voice Interaction System, Data Traceability Protocol, Translation & Localization, Eos Lumina Language

## Key Deliverables
1. Terminology audit and consistency checks across all Portal docs.
2. Cross-reference resolution: update all TODOs and placeholders with correct links.
3. Narrative flow review: ensure transitions between acts, paths, and scripts feel cohesive.
4. Oracle Mode cues: embed Eos Lumina prompts in script files.
5. Localization placeholders: mark sections supporting translation/service integration.
6. Final merge and validation: review updated docs as a unified experience.
