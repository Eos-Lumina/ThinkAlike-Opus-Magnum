# ðŸŒ³ Yggdrasil Resonance Realm Specification â€“ The Living Legacy

## 1. Vision & Purpose

The Yggdrasil Resonance Realm is the sacred space dedicated to connecting users across generations. It is the living, branching tree of familial and chosen relationships, where personal and collective legacies are curated, preserved, and passed on. This realm allows users to create enduring time capsules, ensuring their stories, wisdom, and artifacts resonate into the future.

## 2. Core Features

- **FamilyTreeViewer:** A dynamic, interactive visualization of a user's family tree, including both biological and chosen family connections.
- **LegacyContentManager:** A dedicated interface to create, edit, and schedule the release of legacy content (e.g., messages, journals, digital artifacts, video recordings).
- **Temporal Logic (Kairos Engine):** A system that governs the unlocking of legacy content based on specific dates, life events (e.g., a descendant's 18th birthday), or collective milestones.
- **Akashic Record Integration:** Ensures the immutable, secure, and permanent storage of all legacy data, safeguarding it for future generations.
- **Resonant Trust Protocol Integration:** Access to sensitive legacy content is managed through the trust network, ensuring only designated individuals or groups can unlock it.

## 3. User Flow

1.  **Tree Creation:** A user creates or links to their family tree within the Yggdrasil realm.
2.  **Legacy Curation:** The user adds legacy content, attaching specific unlock conditions (e.g., "Release this message to my daughter on her wedding day," or "Share this research with my Hive upon my passing").
3.  **Immutable Storage:** The content is ceremonially committed to the Akashic Record for long-term preservation.
4.  **Legacy Unlocking:** Descendants, designated friends, or community members can access the content only when the temporal and trust-based conditions are met, often accompanied by a small ritual or notification.
