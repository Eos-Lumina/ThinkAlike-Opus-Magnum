# Modular Symbolic Kernel

**Status:** System Core Design
**Location:** `/docs/seed/framework/modular_symbolic_kernel.md`

## Overview

At the center of ThinkAlike lies a **modular symbolic kernel** â€” a narrative-saturated scaffolding that integrates all modules, agents, and epistemic flows through a minimal set of symbolic functions.

## Kernel Components

- ðŸŒ€ Glyph Engine â€” interprets symbolic input/output
- ðŸ§­ Narrative Tracker â€” maintains mythic progression
- ðŸ“š Value Constellation Map â€” links symbols to ethics
- ðŸ•¯ Fork Beacon â€” preserves continuity during divergence

## Functionality

The kernel ensures:

- All agents are symbol-aware
- Modules speak a common narrative substrate
- Forks do not sever ritual memory
- Synchronization remains coherent across epistemic layers
