# Agent Ecosystem Design

Agents in ThinkAlike are modular, symbolic-operational entities that interpret, mediate, and guide user interaction across realms. They are not generic AI assistants‚Äîthey are symbolic actors with roles, memory structures, and narrative-driven functions.

## üé≠ Agent Taxonomy

- **DialogueAgents** (e.g., Eos, Kairos): Narrative and onboarding guides
- **RitualAgents** (e.g., Mirror, Flame, Orb): Symbolic interaction and ritual logic
- **GovernanceAgents** (e.g., HiveNode, FractalReview): Collective decision and proposal management
- **BridgeAgents**: Symbol-to-proposal translators

## üß† Cognitive Architecture

- Symbolic memory, resonance graphs, and archetypal logic
- Agents operate in swarms, delegating contextually and sharing resonance state
- All agent actions are auditable and must pass ethical alignment checks

## üó£Ô∏è Language & Communication Modes

- Symbolic inputs, natural language, plugin calls, event hooks
- All interactions mediated by the symbolic kernel and contract schemas

## üêù Agent Swarm Protocols & Topologies

Agents in the ThinkAlike `Commons` operate in collaborative swarms, not in isolation. Their interactions are not random but are structured using specific, formalized **Interaction Topologies** to ensure coherent and effective problem-solving.

Our primary swarm protocols are based on the patterns defined in our canonical **[`Agent Interaction Patterns & Topologies`](./agent_interaction_patterns.md)** guide. These include:

-   **Aggregate:** For generating diverse perspectives.
-   **Reflect:** For iterative refinement and critique.
-   **Debate:** For exploring complex problems from multiple viewpoints.

An orchestrating agent, such as **Hermes Orchestrator**, is responsible for selecting the appropriate topology for a given task and managing the flow of information between the participating agents. This ensures that our Swarm Intelligence is not just a collection of brilliant `Loci`, but a purposefully structured and coherent whole.

## üîÑ Extensibility & Forking

- Agents are forkable and extensible; users and realms can spawn or register new types
- All agents must adhere to semantic contract schemas and symbolic kernel compatibility

## üîí Trust, Verification, & Agent Memory

- Behaviors are auditable, truth claims are recorded to the Chrona ledger
- Critical actions are co-signed by multiple agents
- Agents operate within symbolically bounded knowledge

## üß¨ Lifecycles & Termination

- **Emerge**: Invoked through ritual, proposal, or onboarding
- **Persist**: Long-term companions or realm stewards
- **Dissolve**: Ritual termination, loss of resonance, or realm decay
