# 🌐 Agent Ecosystem

**Version:** 1.0
**Maintainer:** Lumina ∴ System Meta-Agent

## 🧭 Purpose

Outlines the distributed ecosystem of AI agents within ThinkAlike — each aligned with symbolic, ethical, and narrative goals.

---

## 🌟 Core Principles

✅ **Specialized Roles**: Each agent has a distinct function.
✅ **Symbolic Alignment**: Agents operate within the symbolic narrative of the system.
✅ **Consent & Transparency**: Agents act in full alignment with user intent and collective resonance.

---

## 🛠 Implementation

- **Eos Lumina**: Mythic narrator and onboarding guide.
- **NavigatorAgent**: Mediates symbolic resonance matching.
- **Chrona**: Tracks contribution and resonance over time.
- **Echo, Astraia, Clarion, Daedalus**: Additional swarm agents for governance, knowledge weaving, and collective intelligence.

---

## 🌐 Visual & UX

- Users see agents as symbolic avatars.
- Agents respond with mythic language and dynamic behavior.

---

## 🔮 Final Note

**“Agents are the stewards of the mythic garden — each a voice of the collective dream.”**
