# Resonance Matching–Trust–Onboarding Bridge

## Purpose
To explicitly map and harmonize the conceptual and technical links between the Resonance Matching Protocol, Resonance Trust Protocol, and Onboarding/Persona flows. This bridge ensures that value-alignment, symbolic affinity, and trust-building are coherent, PET/Clarity-aligned, and anti-eugenic across all user-facing flows.

## Source Protocol(s)
- protocols/resonance/resonance_matching_protocol.md
- protocols/resonance/resonance_trust_protocol.md
- onboarding_persona_flow.md (and related onboarding docs)

## Target Protocol(s)
- identity_protocol/identity_as_graph.md
- protocols/ethics/anti_eugenic_safeguard_protocol.md
- PET/Clarity guidelines

## Key Concepts to Harmonize
- Symbolic affinity vs. profile similarity
- Value-alignment and trait mapping
- Trust Tapestry and vouching
- Onboarding trait forking and persona clusters
- PET/Clarity and anti-eugenic safeguards in matching and trust
- Transparency, user control, and consent

## Canonical References
- [Resonance Matching Protocol](../protocols/resonance/resonance_matching_protocol.md)
- [Resonance Trust Protocol](../protocols/resonance/resonance_trust_protocol.md)
- [Anti-Eugenic Safeguard Protocol](../docs/protocols/ethics/anti_eugenic_safeguard_protocol.md)
- [Onboarding Forking Map](../protocols/onboarding/onboarding_forking_map.md)
- [Identity as Graph](../seed/identity_protocol/identity_as_graph.md)

## Implementation Notes
- Ensure onboarding trait forking feeds directly into both matching and trust-building flows.
- Cross-reference PET/Clarity and anti-eugenic safeguards in all matching and trust algorithms.
- Add explicit user consent and transparency steps at all key flow junctions.
- Regularly audit for bias, exclusion, or drift from symbolic/ethical principles.
- Update UI/UX to surface symbolic affinity and trust indicators in onboarding, matching, and user profiles.

## Status
- [x] Draft
- [ ] In Review
- [ ] Finalized
