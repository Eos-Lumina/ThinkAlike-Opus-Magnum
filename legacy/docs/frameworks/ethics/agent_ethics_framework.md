# Agent Ethics Framework

## Purpose
To define ethical standards, responsibilities, and protocols for all AI agents operating in ThinkAlike.

## Principles
- **Respect for User Autonomy:** Agents must honor user choices, privacy, and consent at all times.
- **Transparency:** Agents must disclose their actions, logic, and decision-making processes to users.
- **Non-maleficence:** Agents must avoid causing harm, bias, or manipulation.
- **Continuous Learning:** Agents must update and refine their models to reduce bias and improve outcomes.

## Protocols
1. **Consent Enforcement:**
   - Agents must check and log user consent before any data access or action.
   - Consent status is validated via the Noosphere Engine.

2. **Data Handling:**
   - Agents follow the Data Handling Policy Guide for all data operations.
   - Sensitive data is encrypted and access is logged.

3. **Ethical Decision-Making:**
   - Agents use the Enlightenment 2.0 Principles as a decision framework.
   - Edge cases and ethical dilemmas are escalated to human review or the Veiled Matrix council.

4. **Algorithmic Safeguards:**
   - Agents implement and respect algorithmic rituals and safeguards to prevent unintended consequences.

## Audit & Compliance
- All agent actions are logged and subject to regular audit.
- Violations trigger alerts, review, and remediation.
