# Ethics by Design Tooling Concept

## Purpose
To provide developers and designers with tools that embed ethical principles, consent management, and auditability into every stage of ThinkAlikeâ€™s design and development process.

## Tooling Features
- **Ethics Checklist:** Automated checks for compliance with ethical guidelines and principles.
- **Consent Management:** Integrated modules for tracking, updating, and auditing user consent.
- **Bias Detection:** Tools for testing and mitigating bias in algorithms and data.
- **Audit Logging:** Automated logging of design and code decisions for transparency.
- **Stakeholder Review:** Interfaces for ethics council and community feedback during development.

## Integration
- Tooling is embedded in development pipelines, code reviews, and deployment workflows.
- All modules and agents must pass ethics checks before release.

## Roadmap
- Expand tooling for real-time ethics monitoring and reporting.
