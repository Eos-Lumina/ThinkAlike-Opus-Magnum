## ⚭ OVERVIEW
Fork Entropy Metrics provide a symbolic, PET/Clarity-aligned framework for tracking the complexity and evolution of a user's forked identity, narrative choices, and ritual engagement within ThinkAlike. These metrics are used by agents (e.g., ResonanceAgent, MirrorAgent) to propose helpful rituals (such as a "mirror_mode merge ritual") or simplifications, always upholding user sovereignty and non-coercive, non-extractive principles.

---

## 👁️‍🗨️ VISUAL RESONANCE & STATES
- **Symbolic Logging:** All entropy logs are symbolic—numerical values (e.g., glyph_entropy: 0.73) are interpreted by agents as cues for narrative or ritual intervention, never as performance scores or user rankings.
- **User Visibility:** Metrics are surfaced to users only through PET/Clarity-compliant, narrative-driven agent suggestions (e.g., "Your journey is branching beautifully. Would you like to merge some paths?").
- **States:**
  - Default: Metrics are logged and interpreted by agents only.
  - Ritual Suggestion: User is invited to participate in a ritual (e.g., merge, simplify, reflect) based on symbolic thresholds.
  - Reset/Fork: User can always reset, fork, or erase trails at will.

---

## ⚙️ FUNCTIONAL CORE & INTERACTION DYNAMICS
### Core Heuristics
- **Branch Width:** Number of active narrative forks.
- **Trail Depth:** Depth of the longest narrative path.
- **Glyph Variance:** Symbolic diversity of choices (e.g., archetype, value, ritual glyphs).
- **Narrative Tension:** Degree of unresolved symbolic or emotional threads.

### Example Symbolic Entropy Log
```yaml
user_id: did:example:123
session_id: 2025-06-08T12:34:56Z
metrics:
  branch_width: 4
  trail_depth: 7
  glyph_entropy: 0.73
  narrative_tension: 0.41
agent_suggestion: trigger mirror_mode merge ritual
```

---

## 🧭 USAGE PROTOCOLS & ACCESSIBILITY
- **Agent Usage:** Metrics are used by agents to propose rituals, simplifications, or narrative interventions, never to judge or rank users.
- **User Control:** Users can view, reset, fork, or erase their narrative trails at any time. All interventions are opt-in and symbolically framed.
- **Accessibility:** If surfaced, all metrics are explained in plain language and symbolic terms, never as raw numbers.

---

## ⚖️ ETHICAL ALIGNMENT & PET (Privacy, Ethics, Transparency)
- **Privacy:** All logs are user-sovereign and never shared without explicit consent.
- **Ethics:** No performance scoring, gamification, or coercive interpretation. Metrics are symbolic, narrative, and always user-controlled.
- **Transparency:** All agent suggestions based on entropy metrics are explained in clear, narrative-driven language.

---

## ✨ SYMBOLIC RESONANCE & RITUAL INTEGRATION
- **Ritual Triggers:** High entropy or narrative tension may trigger invitations to merge, reflect, or ritualize identity forks.
- **Symbolic Meaning:** Entropy is treated as a mirror for self-discovery, not as a flaw or deficit.
- **Agent Rituals:** MirrorAgent and ResonanceAgent use these metrics to guide users through symbolic rituals (e.g., merge, reflection, simplification) that are always opt-in and PET/Clarity-aligned.

---

## 💻 IMPLEMENTATION ECHOES (Optional)
- Metrics are logged as part of the Veiled Matrix and RitualEngine protocols.
- Agents interpret logs using symbolic, not algorithmic, logic.

---

## ⏳ CHRONICLE OF EVOLUTION (Changelog)
- 0.1.0 (2025-06-08): Initial harmonized draft, restructured for canonical documentation, PET/Clarity, and symbolic/ritual integration.

---

> Fork Entropy Metrics are a symbolic, PET/Clarity-aligned tool for agent-guided ritual and narrative evolution. All design, implementation, and review must follow ThinkAlike's non-coercive, user-sovereign, and symbolic documentation standards.
