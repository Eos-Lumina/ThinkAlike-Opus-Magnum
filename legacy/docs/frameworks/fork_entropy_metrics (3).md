## 🧭 Purpose

Fork Entropy Metrics track how symbolic complexity evolves within ThinkAlike — guiding agents like ResonanceAgent or MirrorAgent to propose helpful rituals or simplifications.

## 🔍 Entropy Heuristics

| Heuristic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Branch Width | Number of divergent options taken |
| Trail Depth | Recursive fork decisions beyond surface level |
| Glyph Variance | Range of symbolic tags assigned to trail |
| Narrative Tension | Contradictory or unresolved choices logged |

---

## 🧪 Example Log

```yaml
trail_id: onboarding_423
branch_width: 4
depth: 3
glyph_entropy: 0.73
suggestion: trigger mirror_mode merge ritual
```

🔐 PET Alignment
All entropy logs are symbolic

Users can reset, fork, or erase trails at will

No performance scoring or coercive interpretation
