# Contributors Documentation

## Purpose

This directory contains all the necessary documentation for individuals wishing to contribute to the ThinkAlike project. It outlines the code of conduct, contribution workflow, and provides resources to get started.

## Contents

```
.
├── code_of_conduct.md                  # Our community standards and expectations.
├── contributing.md                     # The main guide for how to contribute.
├── contributor_dashboard.md            # A central hub for contributor resources.
├── developer_docs_index.md             # An index of all developer documentation.
├── harmonization_cleanup_checklist.md  # A checklist for project maintenance.
└── readme.md                           # This file.
```

## Key Files

- **`contributing.md`**: This is the most important file for new contributors. It provides a comprehensive guide to getting started, the development workflow, coding standards, and our "Swarming" methodology. It supersedes all other quickstart or FAQ documents.
- **`code_of_conduct.md`**: Outlines the standards for behavior in the ThinkAlike community to ensure a respectful and inclusive environment.
- **`contributor_dashboard.md`**: A checklist and collection of links to help contributors navigate the project.

## Usage

Anyone looking to contribute to the ThinkAlike project should start by reading the `contributing.md` file.

## Dependencies

This documentation is self-contained but references other core project documents.

## Notes

The `contributor_quickstart.md` and `contributor_faq.md` files have been deprecated and removed, as their content has been merged into the comprehensive `contributing.md` guide.
