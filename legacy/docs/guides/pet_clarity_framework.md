# PET/Clarity Framework

## Purpose
To establish Privacy, Ethics, and Transparency (PET) as foundational principles for all agents, protocols, and flows in the ThinkAlike ecosystem, ensuring ethical, auditable, and user-centric operations.

## Core Principles
- **Privacy:** Protect user data, context, and interactions at every layer. Explicit consent and data minimization are required.
- **Ethics:** All actions, decisions, and flows must align with ethical standards, including fairness, accountability, and non-discrimination.
- **Transparency:** All processes, decisions, and data flows are traceable, auditable, and open to review.

## Design Patterns
- **Consent Management:** Explicit, revocable consent for all data collection and processing.
- **Auditability:** All actions and decisions are logged and reviewable.
- **Bias Mitigation:** Regular audits and harmonization to surface and address bias.
- **Symbolic Alignment:** Rituals and narratives reinforce PET principles in user journeys.

## Integration Points
- All agents and modules must reference PET/Clarity in their design and documentation.
- Protocols must encode PET/Clarity safeguards and audit mechanisms.
- Contributor guides and onboarding flows must include PET/Clarity standards.
