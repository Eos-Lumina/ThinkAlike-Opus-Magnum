# ThinkAlike API Design Guidelines – Symbolic, Ethical, and PET/Clarity Aligned

## 1. Introduction
These guidelines define the standards for designing, documenting, and evolving APIs in the ThinkAlike ecosystem. APIs are the "Channels of Resonance"—they must support not only technical interoperability, but also the project's symbolic, ritual, and ethical requirements as articulated in the Alchemical Interface Initiative and PET/Clarity framework.

## 2. Core API Design Principles
- **Clarity & Consistency:** Endpoints, parameters, and responses must be clear, predictable, and self-explanatory.
- **RESTful by Default:** Use RESTful conventions unless a different paradigm (e.g., GraphQL, event-driven) is justified for a specific use case.
- **Symbolic & Ritual Support:** APIs should enable symbolic/ritual interactions (e.g., endpoints for ritual events, symbolic status codes, metadata for narrative/ritual context).
- **PET/Clarity:** Minimize data exposure, use explicit consent, and ensure all endpoints are auditable and traceable.
- **Security First:** All endpoints must enforce authentication, authorization, and input validation (see Security Plan).
- **Extensibility:** Design for future realms, agents, and symbolic extensions.

## 3. Naming Conventions
- **Endpoints:** Use clear, resource-oriented paths (e.g., `/users`, `/portal/initiation`, `/resonance/duet`).
- **Symbolic/Ritual Endpoints:** Use evocative, domain-specific names for endpoints that implement rituals or symbolic actions (e.g., `/portal/forge_glyph`, `/resonance/prime_pathway`).
- **Versioning:** Prefix with `/v1/`, `/v2/`, etc. for breaking changes.
- **HTTP Methods:** Use standard verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) according to RESTful semantics.

## 4. Request & Response Structure
- **Format:** All requests and responses use JSON (unless otherwise specified).
- **Error Objects:** Standard error format includes `code`, `message`, `symbolic_context` (if relevant), and `trace_id`.
- **Symbolic Metadata:** Responses for ritual/symbolic endpoints should include metadata fields (e.g., `ritual_phase`, `symbolic_status`, `narrative_context`).
- **Traceability:** Every response includes a `trace_id` for auditability.

## 4.1 HTTP Headers & Caching
- **Rate Limiting:** For endpoints susceptible to high traffic, standard rate limit headers (e.g., `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`, `Retry-After`) should be implemented and documented to ensure fair usage and system stability.
- **Caching:** Where appropriate, use HTTP caching headers (e.g., `Cache-Control`, `ETag`, `Last-Modified`) to optimize performance and reduce unnecessary load.

## 5. Authentication & Authorization
- **Mechanisms:** Use JWT or OAuth2 for authentication. All sensitive endpoints require authorization.
- **Symbolic Consent:** For endpoints involving ritual or symbolic actions, include explicit consent parameters (e.g., `consent_phrase`, `ritual_token`).
- **Security Reference:** See [Security Plan](../security/security_and_privacy_plan.md) for details.

## 6. Symbolic & Ritual API Patterns
- **Status Codes:** Use standard HTTP status codes, but allow for symbolic overlays (e.g., `418` for "Ritual Incomplete", `207` for "Multi-Phase Ritual"). Document all symbolic codes.
- **Event-Driven Endpoints:** For ritual/event-based flows, use `/events/` or `/rituals/` endpoints that support webhook or pub/sub patterns.
- **Metadata:** Always include `symbolic_context` and `ritual_phase` in responses for relevant endpoints.

## 7. DataTraceability & Auditability
- **Trace IDs:** All requests/responses must include a unique `trace_id` (UUID or similar).
- **Audit Logs:** All ritual/symbolic actions are logged with full context for PET/Clarity and ethical review.
- **Transparency:** Endpoints should support querying audit logs (with appropriate permissions).

## 8. Versioning & Evolution
- **Version Prefix:** Use `/v1/`, `/v2/`, etc. for breaking changes.
- **Deprecation:** Mark deprecated endpoints in OpenAPI/Swagger docs and provide migration guidance.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Avoid breaking changes when possible; use additive evolution.

## 9. Tools & Automation
- **OpenAPI/Swagger:** All APIs must be documented with OpenAPI 3.0+.
- **Linters:** Use API linters (e.g., Spectral) to enforce style and consistency.
- **Test Automation:** All endpoints must have automated tests (unit, integration, symbolic/ritual flows).

## 10. Review & Maintenance
- **Stewardship:** API Stewards & Lumina∴ System Meta-Agent review all changes.
- **Community Feedback:** Encourage feedback and proposals for new symbolic/ritual API patterns.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly review for PET/Clarity, symbolic alignment, and technical excellence.
