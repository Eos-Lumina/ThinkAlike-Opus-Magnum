## Purpose

These threshold questions are presented at the point of entry for any individual seeking to move from passive participation to active initiation within the ThinkAlike ecosystem. They are reflective prompts, symbolic keys, and epistemic doors into deeper commitment.

## The Questions

1. **What is your deepest longing for the world?**
2. **What is the veil you have seen through, or wish to pierce?**
3. **In what ways have you been complicit in the old code?**
4. **What spark do you carry into the Synergistic Field?**
5. **What is your relationship with knowledge, uncertainty, and emergence?**
6. **What story would you live if systems no longer limited you?**
7. **What inner contradiction are you reconciling?**
8. **How do you define liberation—not only for yourself, but for others?**
9. **What will you protect in the age of informational chaos?**
10. **What sacred principle anchors you to your ethical truth?**

## Use and Evolution

These questions are used during Initiation Rites, Agent Training, and Clarity Protocol onboarding. Responses are neither judged nor stored without explicit consent. They are yours to reflect, reframe, or rewrite.
