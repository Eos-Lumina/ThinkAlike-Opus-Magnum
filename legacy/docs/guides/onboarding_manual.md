## Getting Started — Actionable Tasks for Digital Revolutionaries

**First Step:**
- **Experience the Initial Portal Initiation:** All journeys in ThinkAlike begin with the foundational Portal Realm experience guided by Eos Lumina∴. This symbolic initiation (Sensory Intro, Eos & 3 Questions, Initiation Glyph, Invocation Phrase) introduces you to our core ethos and your own symbolic anchors.

**Next Steps:**
- **Read the README.md:** Familiarize yourself with the project overview, goals, and vision outlined in the root `README.md`.
- **Review the Ethical Guidelines:** Understand the core values and ethical principles guiding ThinkAlike by reading `docs/ethics/ETHICAL_GUIDELINES.md`.
- **Explore the Codebase:** Once on the "Build ThinkAlike" path, browse the repository to get a feel for the project structure. (See the `ui_components` directory for harmonized UI specs.)
- **Contribute to UI Component Development:** If you choose the "Build ThinkAlike" path, help expand the UI component library or enhance existing ones.
- **Improve Documentation:** Identify areas in the documentation (like this manual!) that could be clearer or more detailed, and submit a pull request.
- **Engage with the Gamified Narrative Guide:** If you wish to contribute, review the [Gamified Narrative Guide](../development_framework/gamified_narrative_guide.md) to understand contributor roles, quests, and the Swarm Roadmap.
