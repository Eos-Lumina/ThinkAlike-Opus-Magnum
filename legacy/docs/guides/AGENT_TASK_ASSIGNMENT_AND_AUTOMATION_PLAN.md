# Agent Task Assignment & Automation Plan for Consolidation

This plan outlines how to assign agents (human or AI) and automate tasks for maximum efficiency and care during the final consolidation and publication process.

## 1. Task Assignment by Protocol Cluster
- Assign a dedicated agent (or team) to each protocol cluster (core, identity, data, governance, etc.).
- Each agent is responsible for:
  - Completing the cluster's `HARMONIZATION_TODO.md` checklist
  - Merging legacy/alternate content into canonical protocols
  - Ensuring all frontmatter and harmonization notes are up to date
  - Archiving and redirecting legacy/alternate drafts
  - Logging all actions in migration logs

## 2. Automation Guidelines
- Use scripts or automation tools for:
  - Scanning for duplicates, orphans, and misplaced files
  - Verifying that all files are referenced in `manifest.yaml` and `STRUCTURE_MANIFEST.md`
  - Checking that all cross-references in docs, protocols, and code point to canonical files
  - Generating or updating protocol indexes and overviews
  - Creating redirect notices in legacy file locations
- All automation must:
  - Run in dry-run mode first and log proposed actions
  - Require explicit confirmation before making changes
  - Log all actions for review

## 3. Quality Assurance & Review
- After each cluster is harmonized, assign a different agent to review the work for:
  - Completeness of harmonization
  - Accuracy of documentation and cross-references
  - Absence of duplicates, orphans, and misplaced files
- Use the `FINAL_CONSOLIDATION_CHECKLIST.md` as a master QA list

## 4. Communication & Escalation
- Agents should document any ambiguities, missing files, or structural issues in the migration log
- Escalate unresolved issues to project maintainers for decision

## 5. Publication Readiness
- When all clusters are harmonized and reviewed, perform a final project-wide audit
- Confirm all documentation, manifests, and indexes are up to date
- Prepare a release announcement and update public-facing documentation

By following this plan, agents can work in parallel with maximum care, transparency, and quality control, ensuring the project is ready for publication.
