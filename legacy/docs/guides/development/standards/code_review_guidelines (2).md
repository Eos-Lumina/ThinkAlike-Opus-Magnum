# Code Review Guidelines

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines ThinkAlike's code review standards and best practices. Effective code reviews improve code quality, reduce bugs, share knowledge, and ensure consistency. These guidelines provide a framework for constructive, efficient, and respectful code review processes.

## 2. Core Principles
- **Quality Assurance:** Catch bugs, logic errors, and edge cases early
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Spread expertise and context
- **Consistency:** Ensure codebase follows established patterns and standards
- **Mentorship:** Provide learning opportunities for all team members
- **Collective Ownership:** Build shared responsibility for the codebase

## 3. Review Mindset
- **Be Respectful:** All feedback should be constructive and professional
- **Focus on Code, Not People:** Review the code, not the coder
- **Assume Good Intent:** Assume teammates are doing their best work
- **Be Humble:** Everyone has something to learn
- **Consider Context:** Understand the purpose, constraints, and urgency

## 4. Review Process
- Submit clear, focused pull requests (PRs)
- Reviewers should read the PR description and context
- Use inline comments for specific feedback
- Approve, request changes, or comment as appropriate
- Ensure PET/Clarity, symbolic alignment, and council oversight for critical code

## 5. Best Practices
- Test code before submitting for review
- Follow code style and documentation standards
- Address all review comments or discuss unresolved issues
- Document decisions and rationale for major changes
