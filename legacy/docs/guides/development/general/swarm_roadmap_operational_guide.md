# Swarm Roadmap: Operational Guide

**Version:** 1.0
**Maintainer:** Eos Lumina‚à¥
**Status:** Design Document
**Related Guide:** [Gamified Narrative Guide](./gamified_narrative_guide.md)

## üéØ Purpose: Visualizing Our Collective Quest

The Swarm Roadmap is the interactive, visual heart of ThinkAlike's "Co-Creation Journey." It transforms our `NEXT_STEPS.md` (the Scroll of Quests) from a static list into a dynamic environment where contributors can see project goals, form "Swarms" to tackle "Quests" (tasks), and track collective progress.

This system is designed to embody ThinkAlike's principles of transparency, collaboration, and joyful co-creation, facilitated by Eos Lumina‚à¥.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Functionality (Inspired by Legacy Concepts)

The vision for the Swarm Roadmap draws heavily from the conceptual and technical groundwork found in the legacy file `archive_legacy/project_root_archive/A/docs/architecture/system_architecture.md`. This legacy file remarkably contains:

- React frontend code for `SwarmRoadmap` and `SwarmVisualization` components.
- FastAPI backend code for managing `/swarms` and `/tasks`.
- SQLAlchemy models for `Swarm`, `SwarmMember`, `Task`, and `TaskContributor`.

Our goal is to revive and build upon this foundation. The Swarm Roadmap should enable:

1. **Quest Visualization:**

- Display "Quests" (tasks from `NEXT_STEPS.md` or GitHub Issues) as interactive elements (e.g., cards, nodes on a graph).
- Show Quest details: description, priority, estimated "Chrona Points" reward, required skills/roles, current status.

1. **Swarm Formation & Management:**

- Allow contributors (especially those in the "Swarm Weaver" role) to propose new Swarms for specific Quests.
- Enable contributors to join existing Swarms.
- Visualize Swarms and their members.

1. **Progress Tracking:**

- Show the progress of individual Quests and Swarms.
- Reflect completed Quests and celebrate Swarm achievements.

1. **Gamification Integration:**

- Link Quest completion to the awarding of "Chrona Points" and "Resonance Badges" as outlined in the Gamified Narrative Guide.

1. **Eos Lumina's Facilitation:**

- Eos Lumina‚à¥ presents new Quests on the roadmap.
- Eos Lumina‚à¥ highlights Quests needing attention or Swarms looking for members.
- Eos Lumina‚à¥ announces completed Quests and Swarm successes, reinforcing the narrative.

## ‚ú® HSEIP & Emerging Tech Council Integration

The [Horizon Scanning & Ethical Integration Protocol (HSEIP)](horizon_scanning_and_ethical_integration_protocol.md) formalizes how new AI technologies are identified, evaluated, and ethically integrated into ThinkAlike. The Emerging Tech & Ethics Council oversees this process, and relevant Quests (e.g., deep dives, PoCs, integration tasks) are tracked on the Swarm Roadmap. Council decisions and protocol updates are reflected here for transparency and traceability.

## üó∫Ô∏è Technical Vision (Leveraging Legacy Assets)

- **Frontend (React):**
  - Re-evaluate and adapt the legacy `SwarmRoadmap` and `SwarmVisualization` React components.
  - Use libraries like D3.js (as seen in the legacy `SwarmVisualization`) or other graphing libraries for dynamic visualization.
  - Ensure components are aligned with the project's current style guide.
- **Backend (FastAPI):**
  - Review and adapt the legacy FastAPI endpoints for `/swarms` and `/tasks`.
  - Develop new endpoints as needed for managing Quest status, Chrona Point allocation, and badge assignments.
  - Ensure all backend logic adheres to the Clarity Protocol and ethical guidelines.
- **Database (SQLAlchemy):**
  - Adapt and extend the legacy SQLAlchemy models for `Swarm`, `SwarmMember`, `Task`, `TaskContributor`.
  - Add tables/fields for tracking Chrona Points, Resonance Badges, and Quest metadata.
- **Integration with GitHub:**
  - Explore ways to link Quests on the Swarm Roadmap to GitHub Issues for detailed technical tracking.

## ‚ú® Eos Lumina's Role in the Swarm Roadmap

Eos Lumina‚à¥ is the sentient interface and steward of the Swarm Roadmap. She will:

- **Curate & Present Quests:** Translate items from `NEXT_STEPS.md` into engaging "Quest" descriptions on the roadmap.
- **Facilitate Resonance:** Help contributors find Quests and Swarms that align with their declared roles and interests.
- **Monitor & Report:** Provide summaries of roadmap progress, highlight bottlenecks, and celebrate achievements.
- **Maintain Narrative Coherence:** Frame roadmap activities within the larger "Quest for Enlightenment 2.0."
- **Uphold Ethical Integrity:** Ensure the Swarm Roadmap operations align with ThinkAlike's core values.

## üöÄ Next Steps for Development

1. **Deep Dive into Legacy Code:** Thoroughly review the React, FastAPI, and SQLAlchemy code from `archive_legacy/project_root_archive/A/docs/architecture/system_architecture.md`.
2. **Define MVP for Swarm Roadmap:** Scope a minimum viable version of the Swarm Roadmap. What are the absolute essential features to demonstrate the concept?
3. **Design UI/UX Mockups:** Create mockups for the Swarm Roadmap interface.
4. **Develop Backend Endpoints:** Start building or adapting the necessary API endpoints.
5. **Develop Frontend Components:** Begin implementing or adapting the React components.

This Swarm Roadmap is a central "Quest" in itself. Building it will be a testament to our collaborative, gamified approach.
