# User Stories Guide (Canonical)

## 1. Introduction
This guide collects canonical user stories for ThinkAlike, supporting ethical, user-centered, and PET/Clarity-aligned development. User stories are organized by mode and role, and are validated through UI-driven workflows.

## 2. User Story Examples
### Mode 1: Discovering Your Narrative
- As a user, I want to explore my values in an interactive journey, so I can better understand myself and find compatible partners.
- As a user, I want to see how my choices influence the data that is being collected by the system, and to know how my data is being used.
- As a user, I want to be guided through my self discovery process without being forced into any pre-determined algorithmic choices.

### Mode 2: Personalized Matching and Discovery
- As a user, I want to view AI-powered video avatars that represent different users, so I can explore their personalities and preferences.
- As a user, I want to see all the data parameters that influence AI-driven choices and control what data can be used during that process.
- As a user, I want to have control over the matches I choose to explore, and validate if the system's choices are aligned with my expectations.

### Mode 3: Building Communities with Shared Purpose
- As a user, I want to create, manage, and join communities based on shared values, interests, and ethical principles, using data as a tool to empower my choices.
- As a user, I want full control of how my data is used during group activities, and actionable tools to test my user experience and the technology's effectiveness.
- As a user, I want access to different implementation workflows, using clear and actionable data parameters that promote transparency, and to test code, design, and AI during all cycles.

### Technical User Stories
- As a developer, I want to use clear UI parameters to ensure my code works correctly and data is handled ethically.
- As a designer, I want to use data and user feedback to enhance UI workflows, creating a more responsive and adaptable interface.
- As a tester, I want to use real user data to create testing scenarios, to validate workflows and ethical guidelines.
- As a developer, I want clear documentation of all API endpoints, with security protocols and user data parameters.

### Security User Stories
- As a user, I want full control over my data privacy settings so I can choose what information I share and with whom.
- As a user, I want to be notified immediately of any security breaches or unusual activities.
- As a user, I want real-time visibility about security implementations and the power to modify them according to my needs and values.
