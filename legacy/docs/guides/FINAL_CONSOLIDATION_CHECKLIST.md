# Final Consolidation Checklist for Publication

This checklist ensures the ThinkAlike project is fully harmonized, canonical, and ready for public release.

## 1. Protocol Harmonization (All Clusters)
- [ ] For each protocol, confirm the canonical version:
    - [ ] Merges all valuable content from legacy/alternate drafts
    - [ ] Has up-to-date, complete frontmatter (title, version, status, last_updated, maintainers, tags, related_docs, harmonization_note)
    - [ ] References all relevant architecture docs and protocols
- [ ] Archive all legacy/alternate drafts to `_legacy/archived_protocols/`
- [ ] Add redirect notices in old locations of legacy/alternate files
- [ ] Log all actions in migration logs

## 2. Indexes and Manifests
- [ ] Ensure `manifest.yaml`, `STRUCTURE_MANIFEST.md`, and all protocol indexes reference only canonical, harmonized files
- [ ] Remove or redirect any duplicate, outdated, or misplaced files

## 3. Documentation and Readiness
- [ ] Update all README and overview files to reflect the harmonized, canonical structure
- [ ] Clearly document the harmonization process and provenance in migration logs and harmonization notes

## 4. Final Audit
- [ ] Confirm every protocol, doc, and module is in its canonical location and referenced in the manifest
- [ ] Ensure no duplicates or orphaned files remain
- [ ] Validate all cross-references (in docs, protocols, and code) point to canonical files

## 5. Ready for Publication
- [ ] Project is clean, canonical, and ready for public release

Use this checklist as you complete the final consolidation. Mark each item as you go to ensure nothing is missed before publication.
