# ThinkAlike Onboarding Briefing for AI Agents & New Collaborators

## Project Overview and Mission
ThinkAlike is an open-source project building a decentralized platform to foster authentic human connections, ethical AI, and community empowerment. Inspired by "Enlightenment 2.0," we revolutionize digital interaction, prioritize user agency, data transparency, and ethical technology for a more equitable, human-centered digital world.

## Core Values
- Human-Centered Approach
- Ethical AI
- Transparency & Traceability
- User Empowerment
- Authenticity & Meaningful Connections
- Social Responsibility
