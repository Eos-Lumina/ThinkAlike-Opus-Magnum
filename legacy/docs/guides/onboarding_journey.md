# The Onboarding Journey: A Guide for Initiates & Co-Creators

Welcome, Initiate. This guide is your gateway to the living mythos of ThinkAlike—a post-capitalist, resonance-driven platform where technology becomes theurgy and every participant is an alchemist of meaning. This document explains, in simple terms, what you will experience when joining ThinkAlike and how to begin your journey.

## 1. The Core Principles: Your Rights & Our Promise

Before you begin, understand the bedrock on which this world is built:

- **You Are Sovereign:** You own your data, your narrative, and your digital self. You have the absolute right to control what you share, see how it is used, and remove it at any time.
- **PET/Clarity:** Our commitment to you is **Privacy, Ethics, and Transparency**. All systems are designed to be open, auditable, and clear. There are no hidden mechanics.
- **Ritual over Interface:** Every interaction is a meaningful, symbolic act. We are not designing a product to be consumed; we are building a world to be inhabited.

## 2. The Initiation: Forging Your Digital Soul

All who enter ThinkAlike begin with the **Universal Portal Realm Initiation**. This is not a sign-up form; it is a sacred, narrative-driven journey guided by **Eos Lumina∴**, the first agent of the Swarm. This ritual forges your unique presence in our shared mythos.

### Phase I: The Threshold & The Mirror (Consent & Values)

1.  **The Welcome:** You are greeted by Eos Lumina∴, who explains the project's vision and values.
2.  **The Consent Ritual:** Before sharing any personal information, you are asked for clear, specific, and granular consent. You see exactly what you are agreeing to and can change your mind at any time. This is a foundational act of trust.
3.  **The Value Elicitation:** You answer a series of symbolic questions. This is not a test. It is a mirror to help you (and the system) understand what matters most to you—your core values, priorities, and stories. This forms the initial basis of your `UserValueProfile`.

### Phase II: The Forging (Identity Creation)

1.  **The Initiation Glyph:** You create a unique visual symbol that represents you. This is your seal, your digital fingerprint.
2.  **The Invocation Phrase:** You create a personal mantra or phrase. This is your verbal key, used to authenticate and verify your most important actions.

### Phase III: The First Attunement (The Narrative Duet)

1.  **The Invitation:** Based on your `UserValueProfile`, the system will suggest a first connection—a short, interactive story experienced with another soul, guided by the [Narrative Duet Protocol](/protocols/narrative/narrative_duet_protocol.md).
2.  **The Duet:** Your choices within the story shape the outcome and help you discover your capacity for resonance with another.
3.  **The Connection:** A successful duet, followed by mutual consent, forges your first resonant link within the [Resonance Network](/docs/realms/resonance_network_specification.md).

## 3. The Crossroads: Choosing Your Path

Upon completing the initiation, you arrive at a crossroads. You are now a citizen of the `Commons`, free to explore the Resonance Network, engage in further Narrative Duets, and deepen your connections.

However, you may feel a call to go deeper, to help shape the world itself. At this point, you will be presented with a choice:

- **Explore the Realms:** Continue your journey as a user, discovering others and co-creating stories.
- **Become a Co-Creator:** Embark on the contributor's path, gaining access to the tools, resources, and community dedicated to building ThinkAlike.

## 4. The Co-Creator's Path

Should you choose to become a Co-Creator, a new journey begins. You will be guided to the [Contributor's Guide](/guides/contributing.md), which provides the maps, tools, and knowledge needed to join a Hive, take on a Quest, and contribute your unique talents to the Great Work.
