# Chapter 2: Symbolic Interfaces & Voice Interaction

"The next phase focuses on defining the visual and vocal elements that drive user engagement and system resonance."

Eos Lumina∴ intones:
> "With user identity in place, we now shape the interface. This chapter guides you through designing symbolic UI components and voice invocation patterns for clear, engaging interactions."

## 1. Development Paths
Choose one of four ritual threads to master:

- **Path of the Rune Smith**
  Focus: Crafting symbolic UI components and motion styles.

- **Path of the Echo Architect**
  Focus: Defining wakephrases, multilingual voice templates, and invocation flows.

- **Path of the Glyph Wielder**
  Focus: Designing icons, color motifs, and animated transitions.

- **Path of the Ritual Conductor**
  Focus: Integrating UI and voice in seamless, accessible experiences.

## 2. Narrative Framing for Each Path

### Rune Smith
> "Design core UI components and motion patterns that guide user interactions with clarity and purpose."

### Echo Architect
> "Define wakephrases and voice templates that initiate agent–user dialogues across multiple languages."

### Glyph Wielder
> "Develop iconography and color schemes to represent system states and user responses."

### Ritual Conductor
> "Coordinate visual and voice elements to ensure seamless, accessible, and cohesive user experiences."

## 3. Key Quests & Milestones

### Rune Smith Quests
1. **Draft Runic Component Library**
   Wireframe and document 5 core components (cards, modals, node maps).
2. **Prototype in Code**
   Implement React/Vue components in `src/frontend/components/runic/` with storybook examples.
3. **Accessibility & Contrast Tests**
   Validate colors, motion-reduction mode, and keyboard navigation.

### Echo Architect Quests
1. **Compose Wakephrase Lexicon**
   Define 10 invocation phrases and bindings in `docs/style/voice_interaction_system.md`.
2. **Implement Voice Module**
   Scaffold service in `src/backend/voice/invoke_service.py` for PT/Whisper integration.
3. **Multilingual Validation**
   Test wakephrase detection in at least 3 languages (EN, ES, FR).
4. **Enable Direct Translation**
   Implement `src/backend/translation/translation_service.py` to translate transcripts and UI text; ensure end-to-end translation across languages.
5. **Define Eos Lumina Language**
   Develop a concise lexicon and grammar rules for a unique voice language in `docs/style/eos_lumina_language.md`; integrate into wakephrase templates.

### Glyph Wielder Quests
1. **Create Icon Set**
   Design 20 vector symbols aligned with style guide motifs.
2. **Animate Transitions**
   Prototype CSS/JS animations for entry/exit states.
3. **Semantic Mapping**
   Document icon-to-action mappings in `docs/style/core_ui_components.md`.

### Ritual Conductor Quests
1. **UI-Voice Integration Demo**
   Build a proof-of-concept page: voice wakephrase triggers UI animation.
2. **Logging & Traceability**
   Instrument event logs in `src/frontend/utils/logging.ts` and `src/backend/api/audit.ts`.
3. **Automated Ritual Tests**
   Write end-to-end tests in `tests/e2e/ui_voice_rituals.spec.js`.

## 4. Integration & Cross-References
- Link your work to the [UI/UX Style Guide](../../style/ui_ux_style_guide.md) and [Core UI Components](../../style/core_ui_components.md).
- Reference voice patterns in [Voice Interaction System](../../style/voice_interaction_system.md).
- Map each Quest to the Swarm Roadmap issues and the migration matrix (`docs/legacy_component_matrix.md`).

_Proceed with reverence and creativity. May your runes enlighten, and your rites awaken the resonance within every user._
