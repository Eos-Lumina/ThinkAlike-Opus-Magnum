# Guide: Building a Backend API Endpoint in ThinkAlike

## Preamble: The Ritual of API Creation

Architect of the Unseen Weave, this guide illuminates the process of forging new pathways within ThinkAlike's backend—the digital conduits through which intention, data, and resonance flow. Each endpoint is more than a technical interface; it is a carefully crafted gate within our "Living OS," subject to the same principles of PET/Clarity, ethical integrity, and symbolic coherence that govern all aspects of our ecosystem.

While this guide is technical, remember: every endpoint should serve the higher aims of the platform—fostering connection, user sovereignty, and ethical resonance.

## 1. Planning & Design

- **Define the Endpoint: Charting a New Flow**
  - Clearly articulate the endpoint's purpose and intended impact.
  - Ensure the function is unambiguous and not overly broad.
- **Verification Needs**
  - Identify what must be validated, including not only functional requirements but also alignment with core ThinkAlike values and ethical principles (see [Governance Specification](../../realms/governance/governance_specification.md) and [AI Ethical Implementation Guide](../developer_guides/ai/ai_ethical_implementation_guide.md)).
- **Permissions**
  - Apply the principle of least privilege; permissions must always respect user consent boundaries.
- **Documentation**
  - Document not just technical details, but also the purpose and ethical implications of the endpoint.
- **Symbolic & Ethical Considerations for API Endpoints**
  - **Data Minimization:** Request and return only the data absolutely necessary for the stated purpose.
  - **Clarity of Purpose:** Avoid endpoints that could be misused or are ambiguous in function.
  - **User Sovereignty:** Ensure all operations on user data are backed by auditable user consent (see ConsentLog in portal_specification.md and Data Handling Policy Guide).
  - **No Dark Patterns:** API behavior must be predictable and never designed to trick or coerce frontend applications or users.
  - **Resonance Fingerprint/Social LLM Impact:** If the endpoint influences a user's Resonance Fingerprint or the Social LLM, document and ethically review this impact.

## 2. Implementation Steps

### 2.1. Define the Endpoint: Charting a New Flow
- Use FastAPI's `@app.post`, `@app.get`, etc., to define the route.
- Specify request/response models using Pydantic.

### 2.2. Permissions & Access Control
- Integrate authentication and authorization checks.
- Ensure all access is logged and auditable.

### 2.3. Implement Service Logic
- Write the core logic for the endpoint.
- Integrate with relevant services, databases, or agents.
- **Verification Hook:**
  - The Verification Service should assess the proposed action against ThinkAlike's core values and ethical guidelines (see [Agent Alignment Directives](../../src/swarm/unaligned/core/agent_alignment_directives.md)).
  - Treat this as a "ritual of attunement"—an ethical gate every action must pass through.

### 2.4. Error Handling & PET/Clarity
- Handle errors gracefully, providing clear, actionable feedback.
- Ensure all error states are transparent and never obscure the cause.

### 2.5. Logging & Traceability
- Log all significant actions, especially those affecting user data or system state.
- Use symbolic/ritual language in log entries where appropriate.

### 2.6. Documentation & Testing
- Document the endpoint, including its symbolic/ethical role.
- Write unit and integration tests for all logic and edge cases.
- Validate PET/Clarity and symbolic/ritual alignment in test cases.

## 3. Review & Integration
- Submit a pull request referencing this guide and the filled-out endpoint spec template.
- Ensure all automated tests and linters pass.
- Request review from at least one other contributor, ideally including an ethics or symbolic/ritual reviewer.
- Update relevant indices or mapping tables if required.

By following this guide, you ensure all backend API endpoints are robust, ethical, symbolically resonant, and fully aligned with ThinkAlike’s core principles.
