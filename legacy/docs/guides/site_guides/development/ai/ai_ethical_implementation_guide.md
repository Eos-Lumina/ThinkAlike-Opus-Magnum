# Ethical AI Implementation Guide

This guide provides specific instructions and best practices for implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) components within ThinkAlike, ensuring strict adherence to our [`Ethical Guidelines`](../../../ethics/ethical_guidelines.md). It complements the [`AI Model Development Guide`](./ai_model_development_guide.md) and references the need for an [`AI Transparency Log`](../../../audit_log.md#ai-transparency-log). <!-- Adjusted link to central audit log -->

Building ethical AI is paramount. All AI/ML development must prioritize user well-being, fairness, transparency, and accountability.

## Core Principles for AI Implementation

1.  **Human-Centricity:** AI should augment user understanding and connection, not manipulate or dictate outcomes. Users remain the focus.
2.  **Transparency & Explainability:** Users and developers must be able to understand _how_ AI influences results (within practical limits). Use techniques that support explainability and meticulously log decisions (see [`AI Transparency Log`](../../../audit_log.md#ai-transparency-log)).
3.  **Fairness & Bias Mitigation:** Actively identify and mitigate potential biases (demographic, cognitive, etc.) in data, algorithms, and evaluation metrics. See Guideline 4.
4.  **Privacy Preservation:** AI models must be trained and operated using techniques that minimize exposure of sensitive user data. Adhere strictly to the [`Data Handling Policy Guide`](../../data/data_handling_policy_guide.md). <!-- Adjusted link -->
5.  **Accountability & Oversight:** Establish clear ownership for AI models, processes for auditing their behavior, and mechanisms for addressing issues. The Verification System plays a role here.
6.  **User Control:** Provide users with meaningful controls over how AI affects their experience (e.g., adjusting matching preferences, understanding profile generation).

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Data Handling for AI

-   **Consent:** Only use user data for AI training/inference if explicit, granular consent has been obtained for that specific purpose (Guideline 2.a). Consent flags must be checked _before_ data is fed into AI pipelines.
-   **Anonymization/Pseudonymization:** Apply strong anonymization or pseudonymization techniques to training data wherever possible, especially if sharing data or using third-party tools. Document the techniques used.
-   **Data Minimization:** Only collect and use the minimum data necessary for the AI task (Guideline 3.a). Avoid collecting sensitive attributes unless absolutely essential and ethically justified.
-   **Secure Storage & Access:** Store AI training data and models securely, applying the same access controls and encryption standards as other sensitive data (refer to general [`Security Guidelines`](../../security/security_guidelines.md) and specific project architecture for details like [`Security Deep Dive`](../../../architecture/security_deep_dive.md) if applicable and current).

### 2. Model Development & Training (see [`AI Model Development Guide`](./ai_model_development_guide.md))

-   **Bias Assessment:** Before and during training, rigorously analyze datasets for potential biases. Use tools and techniques (e.g., fairness metrics, subgroup analysis) to measure bias. Document findings.
-   **Mitigation Strategies:** Employ bias mitigation techniques (e.g., data augmentation, re-weighting, algorithmic adjustments like adversarial debiasing) as needed. Document the chosen strategies and their effectiveness.
-   **Model Selection:** Favor models known for better interpretability (e.g., LIME, SHAP applicable models) where feasible without significant performance loss for the specific task. Document the rationale for model choice.
-   **Evaluation Metrics:** Use a _suite_ of evaluation metrics, including standard performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) AND fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equal opportunity). Define acceptable thresholds for both.
-   **Ethical Review:** Incorporate an ethical review checkpoint before deploying significant AI model changes. This could involve a dedicated ethics council or checklist review process, as outlined in [Governance](../../../governance/README.md).

### 3. AI Inference & Integration

-   **Transparency Logging (see [`AI Transparency Log`](../../../audit_log.md#ai-transparency-log))**:
    -   For every significant AI-driven decision affecting a user (e.g., profile generation element, match suggestion), log:
        -   Input data/features used (or hashes/references).
        -   Model version used.
        -   The output/decision.
        -   Confidence score (if applicable).
        -   Explainability data (e.g., key features contributing to the decision, SHAP values).
    -   This log must be accessible for generating user-facing explanations via the `DataTraceability` component and for internal auditing.

-   **Verification System Hooks:** Integrate AI components with the project's Verification System (details may be in `docs/architecture/verification_system/verification_system_deep_dive.md` - ensure this link is current or adapt to project specifics):
    -   _Pre-check:_ Verify input data conforms to expected formats and potentially basic ethical constraints before feeding to the model.
    -   _Post-check:_ Verify AI outputs against defined constraints (e.g., ensure generated profile text doesn't violate content policies, check match suggestions against user blocks/preferences).

-   **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** For highly sensitive decisions or low-confidence predictions, consider implementing HITL workflows where a human reviews or confirms the AI suggestion before it affects the user.

-   **User Controls:** Design interfaces that allow users to:
    -   Understand _that_ AI is being used.
    -   See _why_ a particular suggestion was made (leveraging transparency logs).
    -   Adjust parameters influencing AI behavior (e.g., matching strictness, topic preferences).
    -   Provide feedback on AI suggestions (potentially adapting mechanisms like those in `docs/security/security_feedback_loops.md` - ensure this link is current or adapt).

### 4. Example: Ethical Matching Algorithm Implementation

_(Conceptual Pseudocode/Steps)_

1.  **Trigger:** User requests profile matches (Mode 2).
2.  **Consent Check (Service Layer):** Verify user has consented to profile matching (`has_consent(user_id, 'consent_profile_matching_v1')`). **Block if no consent.**
3.  **Fetch User Profile (Service Layer):** Retrieve user's `value_profile_summary` and `interests_vector` (only consented fields).
4.  **Pre-Verification (Verification System):** Call `VerificationAPI.verify_matching_preconditions(user_id, parameters)` to check user status, parameter validity, etc.
5.  **Candidate Selection (Matching Service):** Query database/index for potential candidates based on coarse criteria (e.g., activity status, basic filters). Anonymize candidate data retrieved.
6.  **AI Scoring (Matching Service):**
    -   For each candidate, calculate compatibility score using the trained matching model (e.g., `matching_model_v1.3.predict(user_vector, candidate_vector)`).
    -   **Log Input/Output:** Log user vector ref, candidate vector ref, model version, raw score to the [`AI Transparency Log`](../../../audit_log.md#ai-transparency-log).
    -   **Get Explainability:** Generate explanation data (e.g., key dimensions contributing to score) using LIME/SHAP applied to the model. Log this.
7.  **Post-Verification & Filtering (Verification System):** Call `VerificationAPI.verify_match_results(user_id, candidate_id, raw_score)` for each potential match. This checks:
    -   Mutual blocking status.
    -   User-defined exclusion criteria.
    -   Ethical constraints on matching (e.g., prevent echo chamber extremes if designed).
    -   Score threshold checks.
    -   **Filter results based on Verification output.**
8.  **Format Results (Service Layer):** Prepare the final list of anonymized candidate snippets and associated (potentially simplified) explanations derived from the transparency log.
9.  **Return to Frontend:** Send the verified and formatted list.
10. **Frontend Display:** Use `DataTraceability` component (potentially simplified) to allow users to optionally see _why_ a match was suggested.

## Maintaining Ethical AI

-   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor AI model performance _and_ fairness metrics in production. Set up alerts for significant drifts or degradation.
-   **Regular Audits:** Perform periodic audits of AI components against these guidelines, reviewing transparency logs, fairness metrics, and user feedback.
-   **Model Retraining & Updates:** Follow the full ethical development cycle (bias assessment, mitigation, testing) when retraining or updating models. Version models carefully.
-   **Feedback Loops:** Actively solicit and analyze user feedback regarding AI-driven features.

Implementing AI ethically is an ongoing commitment requiring vigilance and adherence to these guidelines throughout the entire lifecycle.
