# Voice Interaction System Protocol

This document defines the system-wide protocols for voice interaction within ThinkAlike. It ensures all voice features are consent-based, privacy-preserving, accessible, and symbolically meaningful.

## 1. Core Principles
-   **Consent First:** The microphone is never active without explicit, user-initiated action (e.g., clicking a "speak" button or using a wakephrase).
-   **Privacy by Design (PET):** Audio is processed ephemerally where possible. Any storage of voice data (e.g., for a video intro) requires granular, specific consent and is subject to the `Data Handling Policy`.
-   **Symbolic Invocation:** Voice commands are framed as "invocations" or "utterances," not just commands. The use of voice is a ritual act.
-   **Accessibility:** A text-based alternative must always be available for every voice-driven feature.

## 2. Wakephrase Invocation
-   **Function:** Symbolic wakephrases (e.g., "Eos, Illuminate...") are used to activate specific agent contexts or system functions without needing to click.
-   **Lexicon:** The lexicon includes standard phrases and specialized terms from the [`eos_lumina_language.md`](eos_lumina_language.md).
-   **Technical:** Requires a lightweight, on-device (or server-side with consent) keyword spotting model.

## 3. Agent Response Protocol
-   **Voice Profile:** AI agents like Eos Lumina∴ use a defined voice profile as specified in `docs/style/voice_synthesis_design.md`.
-   **Modulation:** Agent responses are modulated by user tone and the established symbolic context.
-   **Traceability:** All significant agent utterances are logged conceptually in the `AI Transparency Log` for auditability.

## 4. Translation & Localization
-   **Real-Time Translation:** The system must support real-time transcription and translation to facilitate multilingual interaction.
-   **Service Integration:** Leverages a secure, privacy-vetted translation service (e.g., Azure Translator, Google Cloud Translate).
-   **Process:**
    1.  User A speaks in their language.
    2.  Speech-to-text transcribes the audio.
    3.  The transcript is translated to User B's language.
    4.  Text-to-speech generates the audio for User B. The UI displays the translated text.
-   **Symbolic Integrity:** Translation models should be chosen and potentially fine-tuned to preserve the symbolic and emotional intent of the original utterance where possible.
