# Code Style Guide: Ritual Syntax for Clarity & Resonance

**Code is ritual grammar.** This guide is a "shared grammar"‚Äîa ritual syntax that enables harmonious collaboration and makes our codebase a work of collective poetry. Every line of code is an offering to the Living OS.

## ‚ú® Clarity & Readability (The Clarity Protocol)

- Write code that is clear, well-commented, and easily understood by others.
- Use descriptive variable, function, and component names that are, where appropriate, symbolically resonant.
- Favor explicitness over cleverness.
- Structure code for readability and maintainability.

## üìù Ethical & Symbolic Commenting

-   **Why over What:** Comments should explain not just the *what* and *how*, but the *why*‚Äîespecially the **symbolic intent** or **ethical consideration** behind a piece of logic.
-   **Ritual Markers:** When implementing a feature that corresponds to a defined ritual (e.g., from `portal_specification.md`), mark it in the comments.
-   **Reference:** All code documentation should follow the [`code_documentation_template.md`](code_documentation_template.md).

## üß© Harmonized UI Components
- Use the names and props of harmonized UI components exactly as defined in their respective `.md` specifications (e.g., `NarrativeViewer`, `DataTraceability`).
- Follow established prop naming conventions and documentation style from the [UI Component Development Guide](../guides/development/frontend/ui_component_guide.md).

## üîÑ Consistency
- Follow the formatting, naming, and structure conventions used in harmonized code examples.
- **Indentation:** 4 spaces for Python; 2 spaces for TypeScript/JavaScript/JSON/CSS/HTML.
- **Quotes:** Single quotes for TypeScript/JavaScript; double quotes for Python and JSON.
- Group imports logically and remove unused imports.

## üßπ Clean Code
- Remove dead code and unused variables.
- Refactor for simplicity and maintainability.
