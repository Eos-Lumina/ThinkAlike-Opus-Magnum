# üö® Publication Blockers & Outstanding Tasks

This document tracks all remaining stubs, TODOs, and drafts across the ThinkAlike project. Each item is marked as:
- [ ] To be completed (specify owner or next step)
- [x] Complete or harmonized
- [~] Planned for future phase (not a blocker)

## Publication Blockers Triage Table

| Blocker Description | File/Area | Status | Notes |
|---------------------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Unfinished stubs for Manifesto, Vision, User Personas, Design Specs, Data Models, Traceability, Realms & Certification, Coding Standards, Dev Setup, Testing, Community Guidelines, Moderation, Deployment | See Outstanding Stubs below | ‚ùå | All must be created or filled in with at least minimal content before publication |
| Broken or missing cross-links in indices and READMEs | All major indices (README.md, canonical_file_index.md, docs/README.md, etc.) | ‚ùå | Run a link check and update all navigation/cross-links |
| Unreviewed or legacy files not harmonized or archived | legacy/ and filtered_legacy/ folders, any file marked 'Draft' or 'Review Needed' | ‚ùå | Review, migrate, or archive all legacy/unharmonized files |
| Accessibility and PET/Clarity compliance not verified for all UI, assets, and docs | UI components, assets, docs | ‚ùå | Confirm all meet WCAG AAA, PET/Clarity, and symbolic/ritual standards |
| No single source of truth for onboarding, contributor, and FAQ docs | Onboarding, CONTRIBUTING.md, FAQ, etc. | ‚ùå | Consolidate, cross-link, and verify all onboarding and contributor docs |
| README and navigation inconsistencies | All folders | ‚ùå | Ensure every major folder has a harmonized README/index |

## Major Gaps & Missing Files

- [ ] Data models, ERD, and schemas incomplete (`docs/architecture/data_models.md`, `database_schema.md`)
- [ ] Unified OpenAPI spec and protocol documentation not finished (`docs/api_specs/openapi.json`)
- [ ] Onboarding, user personas, and narrative flows incomplete (`docs/realms/portal/`, `docs/protocols/resonant_trust_protocol.md`)
- [ ] Chrona wallet UI and backend integration missing (`docs/ui_components/`, backend endpoints)
- [ ] Testing, validation, and coverage not unified or tracked (`tests/`, `testing_and_validation_plan.md`)
- [ ] CI/CD, deployment, and observability not implemented (scripts, pipeline config)
- [ ] Some UI components, backend endpoints, and agent migrations in progress
- [ ] Documentation indices, onboarding, and FAQ need harmonization
- [ ] Noetica meta files are placeholders (to be filled by owner)
- [ ] Some folders may lack README/index files

---

## High-Priority Stubs & TODOs
- [x] Create actionable stubs for Chrona wallet, parecon integration, restorative trust, onboarding guide, and unified API/DataTraceability docs (see SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md)
- [ ] Fill in detailed content for Chrona wallet, parecon integration, restorative trust, onboarding guide, and unified API/DataTraceability docs (community contributions welcome)
- [ ] Harmonize economic, trust, and narrative protocol docs (cross-link and clarify)
- [ ] Manifesto, Vision, User Personas: Ensure all are finalized and cross-linked in SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md
- [ ] Design Specs, Data Models, Traceability: Confirm all referenced files exist and are up to date
- [ ] Realms & Certification: Complete specs for all realms (including experimental/edge-case)
- [ ] Coding Standards, Dev Setup, Testing: Finalize and cross-link all developer onboarding docs
- [ ] Community Guidelines, Moderation, Deployment: Ensure all are mapped and accessible

## File-Specific TODOs & Drafts
- [ ] `src/swarm/implementations/eos_lumina_agent.py`: Complete agent logic, NLP, and sub-agent routing

- [ ] `src/frontend/components/pci/PCIProfileBuilder.tsx`: Finalize component imports
- [ ] `src/swarm/unaligned/migration/unaligned_agents_migration_todo.md`: Track and complete agent migration
- [ ] `docs/seed/symbolic_alignment/` and `docs/ui_components/`: Harmonize all drafts and mark as complete or planned
- [ ] `docs/architecture/agent_framework/agent_persona_protocol.md`: Ensure all persona YAMLs and code are cross-linked

## Outstanding Stubs and Review-Needed Items
- Manifesto: Expand with project-wide call to action and vision (`docs/seed/core/scintilla_conscientiae_harmonicae_nascentis.md`)
- Vision & Core Concepts: Expand with concise vision statement and key concepts (`docs/seed/core/core_concepts.md`)
- Target Audience & User Personas: Create (`docs/seed/core/user_personas.md`)
- Architectural Design Specifications: Create (`docs/architecture/design_specifications.md`)
- Data Models & Schemas: Create (`docs/architecture/data_models.md`)
- Data Traceability Component: Create (`docs/ui_components/data_traceability_component.md`)
- Realms & Certification: Create (`docs/architecture/realms_and_certification.md`)
- Coding Standards: Create (`docs/development_framework/coding_standards.md`)
- Development Setup: Create (`docs/development_framework/development_setup.md`)
- Testing Strategy: Create (`docs/development_framework/testing_strategy.md`)
- Community Guidelines: Create (`docs/reference/community_guidelines.md`)
- Moderation Policy: Create (`docs/reference/moderation_policy.md`)
- Deployment & Infrastructure: Create (`docs/reference/deployment_infrastructure.md`)
- Context Manifest (Archive): Create (Archive section)

## General
- [ ] Regularly update SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md and master_reference.md as new modules/specs are added or harmonized
