# The Source of Truth: The Five Pillars of the Commons

This document is the single, authoritative entry point to the ThinkAlike project's documentation. It provides a high-level map to the five foundational pillars of our `Commons`, derived from a holistic analysis of the project's state.

## Core Architectural & Supporting Guides

## The Five Pillars

1.  ### **Pillar 1: Enlightenment 2.0 Philosophy (The WHY)**
    -   The foundational philosophy guiding all project design, emphasizing ethical humanism, positive anarchism, radical transparency, and decentralized, humane technology.

3.  ### **Pillar 3: The Portal Realm (The INITIATION)**

4.  ### **Pillar 4: Resonant Exchange & Post-Capitalist Economy (The FLOW)**

    -   **Canonical Source:** [`docs/realms/marketplace/marketplace_specification.md`](./realms/marketplace/marketplace_specification.md)

5.  ### **Pillar 5: Genealogical Trust & Legacy (The ROOTS)**
    -   The systems for building trust networks and collective memory through genealogical mapping and time capsules, fostering intergenerational connection and ethical alignment.
    -   **Canonical Source:** [`docs/realms/yggdrasil_resonance/README.md`](../realms/yggdrasil_resonance/README.md)

# How to Use This Map (For Humans & AI Agents)

- Start here for a holistic, canonical overview of the ThinkAlike project.
- All major entry points (onboarding, system blueprint, contributor guides, meta/matrix docs) are cross-linked below.
- Placeholders and meta files are clearly marked as 'To Be Populated' where applicable.
- Deprecated/legacy files are noted and point to their canonical replacements.
- For a visual system map, see [`docs/architecture/system_overview_diagram.md`](./architecture/system_overview_diagram.md).
- This map is designed for both human contributors and AI agents to quickly orient, navigate, and understand the full project context.

# Federated Source of Truth Protocol

> **This file is one node in a federated, evolving system of “sources of truth.”**
> - Multiple `source_of_truth.md` files exist (including legacy, archive, and alternate versions).
> - This file reflects the canonical state as of its last update, but is not the only authority.
> - For audit, provenance, and harmonization status, consult the [ThinkAlike Living Archeology Map](../../../ThinkAlike_Living_Archeology_Map.md).
> - For historical context or to recover lost knowledge, review legacy `source_of_truth.md` files (see below).
> - When updating or harmonizing, always reconcile with other source_of_truth files and update the Living Map.

## Legacy Source of Truth Files (for provenance & recovery)
- [docs/_src_archive/Think_Alike/docs/guides/project/source_of_truth.md](../../_src_archive/Think_Alike/docs/guides/project/source_of_truth.md)
- [docs/_to migrate/guides/project/source_of_truth.md](source_of_truth.md) *(this file)*
- [docs/trunk/project/status/source_of_truth.md](../../trunk/project/status/source_of_truth.md) *(current canonical)*
