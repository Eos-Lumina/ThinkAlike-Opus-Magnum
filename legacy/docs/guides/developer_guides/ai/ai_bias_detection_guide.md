# AI Bias Detection Guide

## Purpose
Continuously monitor and audit outputs from various AI engines (text, voice, image) to detect biases related to gender, ethnicity, or other protected characteristics. This guide ensures that AI systems align with ThinkAlike's ethical guidelines and fairness principles.

## Expected Inputs
- Output data from AI modules (e.g., text analysis, voice profile engine, image generation).
- Historical results and user feedback for comparative analysis.
- Fairness benchmarks and predefined metrics for bias detection.

## Processing Logic
- Compare AI outcomes against fairness benchmarks using statistical tests or bias detection frameworks.
- Analyze patterns in AI-generated outputs to identify potential biases.
- Generate detailed reports or flag anomalies for review by developers and ethical auditors.

## Expected Outputs
Example:
```json
{
  "module": "AI Text Analysis Engine",
  "bias_flag": false,
  "confidence": 98,
  "notes": "No significant bias detected."
}
```

## Integration
- **UI Dashboards:** Display bias detection metrics and reports for transparency.
- **AI Transparency Log:** Records bias detection results for accountability and continuous improvement.
- **Model Training:** Provides feedback to refine AI models and mitigate detected biases.
- **Ethical Auditing:** Supports regular audits to ensure compliance with ThinkAlike's ethical framework.

## Ethical Considerations
- **Fairness:** Ensure bias detection methods are inclusive and account for diverse user demographics.
- **Transparency:** Clearly communicate bias detection results to users and developers via UI components.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly update fairness benchmarks and detection algorithms based on user feedback and evolving ethical standards.
- **Privacy:** Protect user data used in bias detection processes, adhering to ThinkAlike's security and privacy policies.

**Migration note:** Harmonized and migrated from multiple legacy sources (see `archive_legacy/legacy_docs/1/--Thin/ai_bias_detection_module.md`). Standardized to Brill-style, updated terminology, and cross-referenced with current ThinkAlike documentation. All compliance and metadata sections included.
