# AI Model Development Guide (Canonical)

## 1. Introduction
This guide provides a unified, up-to-date reference for developing AI models within the ThinkAlike platform. It harmonizes legacy best practices with current ThinkAlike principles: Ethical AI by Design, User Sovereignty, Radical Transparency, Symbolic/Narrative UX, and continuous UI-driven validation. It is intended for all developers and contributors working on AI components, including those integrating with the Persona Calibration Initiative (PCI), Eos Lumina, and HASI.

## 2. Core Principles for AI Model Development and Implementation
- **Ethical AI by Design:** Embed ethical considerations at every stage (data sourcing, model design, training, deployment, monitoring). Reference the [Ethical Guidelines](../../ethics/ethical_guidelines.md) and [Data Governance Policies].
- **Radical Transparency & Explainability:** All models must be auditable, interpretable, and expose their reasoning in a user-comprehensible way. Avoid black-box AI. Leverage UI as a validation and feedback instrument.
- **User Sovereignty & Agency:** Models must empower users, never override their choices, and always provide clear options for control, override, and feedback.
- **Symbolic/Narrative Alignment:** Models should support and enhance the narrative and symbolic experience of Realms. See [system_architecture_overview.md](../../architecture/system_architecture_overview.md) and [symbolic_questions_pool.md].
- **Continuous Validation:** Use UI-driven workflows and the PCI Test Bench for ongoing validation, bias detection, and ethical compliance.

## 3. AI Models in ThinkAlike
- **Persona Calibration Initiative (PCI):** AI models must be testable and calibratable using PCI-generated profiles. Reference [PCI_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md] and ensure compatibility with PCI Test Bench workflows.
- **Eos Lumina & Agent Personas:** If models interact with or are part of Eos Lumina (or similar agents), ensure alignment with her operational principles: ethical guidance, transparency, and user empowerment.
- **HASI, DataTraceability, Verification System:** Model development must account for system-wide features described in [system_architecture_overview.md], including HASI orchestration, DataTraceability, and the Verification System.

## 4. Recommended Frameworks and Libraries
- Use approved frameworks and libraries that comply with ThinkAlike's ethical and technical standards. Reference the [Developer Resources](../../../developer_resources.md) for the current list of approved tools.

## 5. AI Model Development Workflow and Requirements
1. **Ethical Requirements & Value Alignment:**
   - Define ethical requirements and value alignment goals before development.
   - Document potential biases and mitigation strategies.
2. **Data Sourcing & Management:**
   - Source data ethically, with explicit user consent and full traceability.
   - Anonymize/pseudonymize as needed. Document provenance and transformations.
   - Reference PCI, User Sovereignty, and DataTraceability requirements.
3. **Model Design & Architecture:**
   - Prioritize interpretable, modular, and reusable architectures.
   - Design for scalability, testability, and symbolic/narrative alignment.
4. **Training & Evaluation:**
   - Train using ethical practices and bias mitigation.
   - Evaluate for accuracy, fairness, robustness, and ethical alignment.
   - Use UI-driven metrics and PCI Test Bench for validation.
5. **Testing, Validation, & UI Integration:**
   - Integrate with UI for real-time validation, feedback, and transparency.
   - Use reusable UI components (e.g., DataTraceability, CoreValuesValidator).
   - Validate against user needs, ethical guidelines, and PCI/Eos Lumina standards.
6. **Documentation & Transparency:**
   - Document all aspects: data, architecture, training, evaluation, limitations, and ethical considerations.
   - Make documentation accessible for community review.

## 6. UI Integration and Validation Focus
- Ensure AI models are designed for seamless integration with ThinkAlike's UI components.
- Prioritize user-friendly interfaces that enhance understanding and control of AI behaviors.

## 7. Iteration and Continuous Improvement
- Monitor and update models based on user feedback, UI validation, and ethical review.
- Use the PCI Test Bench and community input for ongoing improvement.

## 8. Ethical Testing & Validation
- Implement rigorous testing and validation processes to ensure ethical compliance and performance standards.
- Engage in regular audits and updates of AI models to align with evolving ethical guidelines and technological advancements.
