# Accessibility Implementation Guide (A11y)

## 1. Introduction
Accessibility (a11y) is a core tenet of ThinkAlike’s commitment to Ethical Humanism and Inclusivity. This guide provides practical guidelines and best practices for building accessible UIs in our React frontend, ensuring usability for people of all abilities, including those using assistive technologies.

## 2. Accessibility Principles
- **Perceivable:** Information and UI must be presented in ways users can perceive.
- **Operable:** UI must be usable via keyboard and assistive tech.
- **Understandable:** Information and operations must be easy to understand.
- **Robust:** Content must be compatible with current and future assistive tech.

## 3. Best Practices
- **Keyboard Navigation:** All UI components must be fully keyboard accessible.
- **ARIA Roles:** Use ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility.
- **Contrast Ratios:** Maintain a minimum 4.5:1 contrast for text.
- **Responsive Design:** Components must adapt to all screen sizes/orientations.

## 4. Testing
- **Automated Tools:** Use Axe, Lighthouse, or similar for audits.
- **Manual Testing:** Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS) and keyboard navigation.
- **User Feedback:** Incorporate feedback from users with disabilities.

## 5. Integration & Continuous Monitoring
- **UI Components:** Accessibility features are integrated into reusable components.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Regular audits ensure ongoing compliance.
