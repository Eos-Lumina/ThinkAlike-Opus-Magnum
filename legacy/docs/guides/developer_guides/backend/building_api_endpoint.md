# Building Backend API Endpoints – A Ritual of Alchemical Craft

This document outlines the **sacred craft and ritualized process** for forging new API endpoints within the ThinkAlike FastAPI backend. Each endpoint is a channel of resonance—a conduit for symbolic exchange, ethical clarity, and participatory transformation. All endpoint work must support symbolic/ritual overlays, explicit consent, traceability, and ethical transparency, in full alignment with the Alchemical Interface Initiative and PET/Clarity.

**Prerequisites:**
- Familiarity with Python 3.10+, FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, and RESTful API principles.
- Review the [Code Style Guide](../../style/code_style_guide.md) (Backend & Symbolic Naming sections).
- Review the [Architectural Overview](../../architecture/architectural_overview.md), [API Design Guidelines](../../architecture/api_design_guidelines.md), and [API Documentation Guidelines](../../architecture/api_documentation_guidelines.md).
- Understand the Verification System (see [Verification System Deep Dive](../../architecture/verification_system/verification_system_deep_dive.md)).
- Local backend environment set up as per the [Installation Guide](../../core/installation.md).

By following this harmonized, ritualized process, all backend endpoints will embody ThinkAlike’s symbolic, ethical, and PET/Clarity-aligned standards.
