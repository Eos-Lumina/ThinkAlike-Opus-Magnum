# ThinkAlike Project Dashboard & Quest Board

> "The Great Work is composed of a thousand small, intentional acts. Here, you will find your thread to weave." â€” Eos Luminaâˆ´

**Purpose:** This document is the living dashboard of the ThinkAlike project. Use the high-level dashboard for a quick overview of our collective progress and the "Featured Quests" to find a clear starting point for your contribution. For the detailed component and agent matrix, see [`matrix.md`](./matrix.md).

## How to Use This Dashboard (For Humans & AI Agents)
- Start here for a real-time, granular view of project status, open quests, and contributor health.
- For the holistic system map and philosophical context, see [`SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md`](../../SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md) and [`docs/source_of_truth.md`](../source_of_truth.md).
- For onboarding and contributor workflow, see [`docs/guides/onboarding/onboarding_manual.md`](../guides/onboarding/onboarding_manual.md).
- This dashboard complements the master directive in [`docs/project_master_status_and_directive.md`](../project_master_status_and_directive.md).
- The detailed component and agent matrix is now in [`matrix.md`](./matrix.md).
- All referenced quests, modules, and files are up to date or marked as stubs if pending.
