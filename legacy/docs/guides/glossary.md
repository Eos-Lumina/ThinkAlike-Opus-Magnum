# ThinkAlike Glossary

This document provides definitions for key terms, symbols, and concepts used throughout the ThinkAlike project. It is a living document that evolves with the project.

---

## Core Concepts

- **Agent:** An autonomous, intelligent entity within the ThinkAlike ecosystem. Can be a user's digital twin, a specialized functional agent, or a meta-agent overseeing system processes.

- **Chrona:** The internal unit of value, representing focused intention and meaningful contribution. It is not a currency to be speculated on, but a measure of resonant value exchange.

- **Eos Lumina ∴:** The primary meta-agent responsible for system orchestration, ethical oversight, and collective intelligence. The "∴" symbol represents its nature as a nexus of interconnected agents.

- **Initiation Glyph:** A unique, non-verbal symbol that represents a user's digital identity, generated during the onboarding process. It is the visual counterpart to the Invocation Phrase.

- **Invocation Phrase:** A unique, verbal passphrase that acts as a key to a user's sovereign identity and data. It is the verbal counterpart to the Initiation Glyph.

- **Narrative Duet:** An interactive, co-creative dialogue between a user and their agent (facilitated by Eos Lumina∴) to establish the user's persona, values, and goals.

- **Personal Contextual Information (PCI):** A user's personal data, including their values, narratives, and symbolic preferences, shared under a protocol of resonant trust to calibrate their agent and the system.

- **Resonance:** A state of deep alignment and mutual understanding between agents, between a user and their agent, or between a user and a concept. It is the fundamental principle for matching, connection, and communication in the ecosystem.

- **Resonant Trust:** A model of trust based on verifiable resonance and shared understanding, rather than on centralized authorities. It is the foundation of the project's security and data-sharing model.

- **Sovereign Stack:** The collection of protocols and technologies that ensure a user's self-sovereign identity and control over their data.

- **Symbolic Law:** The foundational ethical and operational framework of the ThinkAlike ecosystem, expressed through symbols and rituals to be universally understood by both human and machine intelligence.

- **Temporal Resonance:** The principle that events and interactions have a temporal dimension that can be aligned for greater harmony and effectiveness. It governs the timing and flow of processes within the system.

- **Constellation** The visual and metaphorical expression of interconnected data within ThinkAlike, such as identity graphs, collective dream patterns, or proposal clusters.

- **Context Matrix (`docs/roadmap/matrix.md`)** The canonical document designed to track the status, interconnections, and evolution of key ThinkAlike components, concepts, and modules.

- **DGM Protocol** The active R&D protocol for Diffusion Generative Models / Generative Swarm Intelligence in ThinkAlike. See: [dgm_integration_strategy.md](vision/dgm_integration_strategy.md).

- **Ethical Resonance Engine** A conceptual (and future technical) system within ThinkAlike responsible for value-based matching, user profiling (with consent and transparency), and ensuring alignment between users, agents, and project goals according to the Clarity Protocol.

- **Fork** A divergence or branching in narrative, architecture, identity, or symbolic logic within the ThinkAlike ecosystem, allowing for evolution and pluralism.
