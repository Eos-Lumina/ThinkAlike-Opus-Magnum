## Part 3: The Current Directive
**CURRENT TASK:** The primary harmonization and restoration phase is largely complete. The project now focuses on:
1.  **Deepening Specifications:** Expanding and refining existing canonical documents.
2.  **Targeted Harmonization:** Addressing any remaining unclassified or legacy documents as they are encountered or prioritized.
3.  **Innovation & Creation:** Drafting new supporting documents, features, and realms.
4.  **Ongoing Review:** Continuously ensuring all project artifacts align with PET/Clarity principles and the Alchemical Interface Initiative.
5.  **Next Immediate Steps:**
    *   Review and harmonize/archive `project_status_and_matrix.md`.
    *   Review and harmonize/archive `contributor_guides/human_contributor_quickstart.md`.

This document will continue to be the primary reference for AI-assisted tasks, reflecting the most current state and directives.
