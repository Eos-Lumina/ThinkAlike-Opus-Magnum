This document outlines the high-level, multi-phase strategic roadmap for the ThinkAlike project, framed as chapters in our collective 'Quest for Enlightenment 2.0.' It provides a long-term vision for the platform's evolution.

## The Five Phases of the Quest

| Phase | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Foundation Phase | Seed documents, symbolic protocols, Eos Lumina agent |
| Swarm Phase | Distributed AI modules, matching engine, Hive coordination |
| Resonance Phase | Collective dream mapping, value constellations, proposal pathways |
| Reflection Phase | Auditable memory, social layer refinement, ethics evaluation |
| Diffraction Phase | Forks, federated experiments, cultural embeddings |

Each phase will be detailed with specific 'Quests' on the interactive Swarm Roadmap.
