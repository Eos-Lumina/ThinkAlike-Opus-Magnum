# Roadmap Visualization: "The Enlightenment Path"

## 1. Core Concept

The ThinkAlike roadmap will be implemented as a dynamic, interactive visualization called **"The Enlightenment Path."** Unlike traditional static roadmaps, this visualization draws inspiration from philosophical journeys and celestial maps, presenting ThinkAlike's evolution as a meaningful progression through stages of development aligned with our core values.

## 2. Design Elements

### 2.1. Visual Metaphor: The Constellation Map

The roadmap is visualized as a star map or constellation, where:
-   **Stars/Nodes:** Represent completed milestones (brighter for more recent).
-   **Constellations:** Group related milestones into complete features.
-   **Nebulae:** Represent areas of active, ongoing development.
-   **Dark Matter:** Represents planned future work (visible but less defined).

### 2.2. Interactive Elements

-   **Zoom Levels:** Allow navigation from a high-level view (major releases) to a detailed view (individual tasks).
-   **Milestone Details:** Clicking on any node reveals details, contributors, and links to relevant documentation.
-   **Contributor Traces:** An optional overlay to highlight the pathways of specific contributors through the project's history.
-   **Ethical Alignment Heatmap:** An optional overlay showing how components align with our core `Enlightenment 2.0 Principles`.

## 3. Technical Implementation

The roadmap will be a React component using D3.js for visualization, with data sourced via the GitHub API from our issues, milestones, and project boards. It will feature real-time updates to reflect ongoing development and will be designed with full accessibility (WCAG AAA) as a primary requirement.
