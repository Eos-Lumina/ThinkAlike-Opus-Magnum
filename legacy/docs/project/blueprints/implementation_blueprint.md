# ThinkAlike Unified Implementation Blueprint

## 1. System Overview
A symbolic, ritual-driven, PET/Clarity-aligned platform for resonance-based connection, co-creation, and governance. All flows are narrative, forkable, and agent-mediated.

## 2. Core Modules & Architecture
- **Narrative Engine:** Branching, ritualized, agent-guided journeys (see: /docs/narrative_engine/)
- **Ritual Engine:** Invocation, logging, and symbolic processing of all system rituals (onboarding, conflict, co-creation, etc.)
- **Agent System:** Modular, mythic agents with archetypal logic, memory, and swarm protocols
- **Resonance Mapping:** Symbolic, value, and epistemic matching (IRS, HAI, resonance graph)
- **Sybil Resilience:** Symbolic verification, ritual friction, swarm trust, and anti-sybil protocols
- **UI/UX Layer:** PET/Clarity-compliant, symbolic overlays, dynamic theming, and ritualized components
- **Data Traceability:** Radical transparency, provenance, and user control

## 3. Technical Requirements & Interfaces
- All modules expose clear APIs (REST/GraphQL or internal service contracts)
- Agents communicate via symbolic contract schemas and event hooks
- UI components are modular, accessible (WCAG AAA), and support symbolic overlays
- All rituals and agent actions are logged and auditable
- PET/Clarity compliance is enforced at every layer

## 4. Implementation Roadmap (Phase 1)
1. **Scaffold Ritual Engine** (invocation, logging, symbolic hooks)
2. **Scaffold Narrative Engine** (branching, agent dialogue, fork registry)
3. **Agent Registry & Swarm Protocols** (archetype matrix, agent invocation, memory)
4. **Resonance Graph & Matching** (IRS, HAI, resonance fingerprint, graph API)
5. **Sybil Resilience Layer** (symbolic verification, ritual friction, agent mimicry detection)
6. **PET/Clarity UI Components** (core validators, data traceability, consent overlays)
7. **Developer Onboarding & Contribution Docs** (ritualized, symbolic, and PET/Clarity-aligned)

## 5. Next Steps
- Create technical specs for each module
- Scaffold code and documentation for Ritual Engine and Narrative Engine
- Implement PET/Clarity UI component stubs
- Integrate agent registry and resonance graph APIs
- Iterate with symbolic/ritual and PET/Clarity review at each step

## 6. Technical Specifications for Core Modules

### 6.1 Ritual Engine
- **Purpose:** Central orchestrator for all system rituals (onboarding, conflict, co-creation, etc.), ensuring symbolic, auditable, and PET/Clarity-aligned flows.
- **Key Components:**
  - Ritual Invocation API (REST/GraphQL)
  - Ritual Log (immutable, auditable event store)
  - Symbolic Hook System (triggers for agent/system actions)
  - Ritual Schema Registry (YAML/JSON schema for ritual types)
- **Interfaces:**
  - `POST /rituals/invoke` (invoke ritual)
  - `GET /rituals/log` (ritual event log)
  - Event hooks for agent/system modules
- **Tech Notes:**
  - All invocations and completions are logged with provenance
  - Symbolic overlays for UI feedback

### 6.2 Narrative Engine
- **Purpose:** Drives branching, agent-guided journeys; manages narrative state, forks, and agent dialogue.
- **Key Components:**
  - Narrative State Manager (tracks user/agent progress)
  - Fork Registry (branching/forking logic)
  - Dialogue Engine (agent/user exchanges)
  - Narrative Schema Registry (YAML/JSON for narrative types)
- **Interfaces:**
  - `POST /narrative/advance` (advance narrative state)
  - `GET /narrative/state` (fetch current state)
  - `POST /narrative/fork` (create/resolve forks)
- **Tech Notes:**
  - All narrative actions are ritualized and logged
  - Supports agent and user-initiated branches

### 6.3 Agent Registry & Swarm Protocols
- **Purpose:** Manages agent archetypes, memory, invocation, and swarm logic.
- **Key Components:**
  - Agent Registry (CRUD for agents/archetypes)
  - Swarm Protocol Engine (collective agent logic)
  - Agent Memory Store (symbolic, event-based)
- **Interfaces:**
  - `POST /agents/invoke` (invoke agent)
  - `GET /agents/registry` (list/query agents)
  - Event hooks for swarm actions
- **Tech Notes:**
  - Agents operate via symbolic contracts
  - Supports archetype matrix and memory replay

### 6.4 Resonance Graph & Matching
- **Purpose:** Symbolic, value, and epistemic matching for connection, governance, and co-creation.
- **Key Components:**
  - Resonance Graph API (graph data structure)
  - Matching Engine (IRS, HAI, resonance fingerprint)
  - Graph Provenance Log
- **Interfaces:**
  - `POST /resonance/match` (initiate matching)
  - `GET /resonance/graph` (fetch graph state)
- **Tech Notes:**
  - All matches are logged and auditable
  - Symbolic overlays for UI feedback

### 6.5 Sybil Resilience Layer
- **Purpose:** Prevents sybil attacks via symbolic verification, ritual friction, and swarm trust.
- **Key Components:**
  - Verification Engine (symbolic/ritual-based)
  - Ritual Friction Protocols
  - Mimicry Detection (agent-based)
- **Interfaces:**
  - `POST /sybil/verify` (initiate verification)
  - `GET /sybil/status` (fetch verification status)
- **Tech Notes:**
  - All verification events are ritualized and logged
  - Integrates with agent and ritual engines

### 6.6 PET/Clarity UI Components
- **Purpose:** Ensures all UI is PET/Clarity-compliant, accessible, and symbolically aligned.
- **Key Components:**
  - Consent Overlay Components
  - Data Traceability Widgets
  - Symbolic UI/UX Elements
- **Interfaces:**
  - Modular React/Next.js components
  - API hooks for provenance and consent
- **Tech Notes:**
  - All UI actions are auditable and reversible
  - Symbolic overlays and dynamic theming
