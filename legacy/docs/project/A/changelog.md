# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
- Harmonized and refactored `docs/roadmap/project_status_and_matrix.md` into a focused "Project Dashboard & Component Status" document, serving as a supplement to the master directive. Updated links and statuses, removed redundant information.
- Moved `project_master_status_and_directive.md` from the project root to `docs/project_master_status_and_directive.md`.
- Updated `README.md` to reflect the new location of `project_master_status_and_directive.md`.
- Created `docs/architecture/security/` directory.
- Moved `security_deep_dive.md` from `docs/unclassified_review/0/` to `docs/architecture/security/security_deep_dive.md` and harmonized its frontmatter.
- Migrated and canonized the Digital Legacy Framework and supporting stories as the foundation of the new Yggdrasil Resonance realm:
  - `realms/yggdrasil_resonance/legacy_framework_specification.md`
  - `realms/yggdrasil_resonance/legacy_narrative_stories.md`
- Added new contributor guide: `docs/guides/developer_guides/building_frontend_component.md`
- Completed harmonization and archival of legacy `ethical_ai_implementation.md` with all unique content merged into the canonical AI Ethical Implementation Guide.
### Harmonized
-   **Core Architectural Guide:** The canonical `docs/architecture/architecture_overview.md` has been fully harmonized. Foundational principles from legacy files (`one_and_many_pattern.md`, `project_metaphor.md`) have been assimilated directly into the document, making it the self-contained source of truth for the project's technical vision and structure.

- Philosophical Enrichment: Harmonized Cluster 1 (Core Philosophy & Vision) by integrating lost knowledge and poetic language from legacy artifacts:
  - Added 'Ecological Awareness' as a seventh core principle in Enlightenment 2.0 Principles.
  - Infused poetic and philosophical language into Radical Transparency and Authentic Connection.
  - Enhanced Core Concepts with explicit sections on 'Ciphers & Playful Discovery' and 'Digital Citizenship & Counter-Model.'
  - Wove Mythic Pattern Language and Sacred Technology concepts into the canonical foundation.
  - All five legacy artifacts (core_values.md, core_concepts.md, emergence_manifesto.md, mythic_pattern_language.md, sacred_technologies.md) are now classified as Superseded (Archive).
- CONSTITUTIONAL HARMONIZATION: The project's core manifesto, `docs/seed/core/scintilla_conscientiae_harmonicae_nascentis.md`, has been surgically updated to align with the canonical Realm structure and the seven ratified principles of Enlightenment 2.0. Its poetic potency has been infused into the new structure, and the original poetic invocation moved to an appendix. The legacy version is now Superseded (Archived). This document is now the ratified Philosophical Constitution of the ThinkAlike project.
-   **Philosophical Foundation Ratified:** Finalized the `scintilla_conscientiae_harmonicae_nascentis.md` as the project's Philosophical Constitution and created its official companion document, the `Manifesto Annex`.
### Added
- Canonized core system documents:
  - `docs/seed/core/system_consciousness_model.md` (System Consciousness Model)
  - `docs/architecture/agent_framework/agent_ecosystem_design.md` (Agent Ecosystem Design)
-   **Canonized Foundational Blueprints:** Ratified and integrated `system_consciousness_model.md`, `agent_ecosystem_design.md`, and the `harmonia_mundi_principle.md` as core canonical documents.
-   **Canonized `temporal_dynamics_protocol.md`:** Established the project's core architectural approach to time, memory decay, and ritual pacing.

## [2025-06-16]
- Canonized and ratified the core philosophy document:
  - `docs/seed/core/pansophism_and_the_commons.md` (Pansophism and the ThinkAlike Commons)
  - Added to master index under 'Core Philosophy'.
- Harmonized and ratified the new canonical contributor guide:
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` (now the single authoritative entry point for all contributors; legacy quickstart and FAQ content integrated)
- Canonized the developer guide for the value-based matching algorithm:
  - `docs/architecture/agent_framework/matching_algorithm_guide.md` (full legacy content migrated and harmonized)
- Legacy files (`contributing.md`, `contributing_detailed.md`, `developer_guide_matching_algorithm.md`) are now archived and superseded by the above canonical documents.
- Canonized the developer guide for value-based matching algorithm at `docs/architecture/agent_framework/matching_algorithm_guide.md`.
- New directory structure for developer guides under `docs/guides/development/` with subfolders for `frontend`, `backend`, `general`, and `product`.

### Changed
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/unclassified_review/archive/provenance_log.md` to reflect new canonical contributor docs and archival of legacy files.
- Reorganized developer guides into the new structure.
- Harmonized philosophical and ethical protocols:
    - Moved conceptual/draft documents from `docs/ethics` to `docs/ethics/concepts/`.
    - Canonical documents retained in `docs/ethics`: `consent_protocol.md`, `data_consent_protocol.md`, `enlightenment_2.0_principles.md`, `ethical_guidelines.md`, `ethical_ui_ux_principles.md`, `ethos.md`, `PET_Clarity_implementation_guide.md`.
    - Deleted redundant `docs/ethics/project_ethos.md` (content merged into `ethos.md`).
    - Updated links in affected documents.

### Removed
- Deleted all legacy `contributor_quickstart.md` files.
- Removed old `developer_guides` directory.
- Archived or deleted redundant/draft philosophical and ethical documents.
### Fixed
- Corrected and populated the empty setup and start command blocks in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Updated broken links in `README.md` to point to `docs/ethics/enlightenment_2.0_principles.md` and `docs/ethics/ethos.md`.

### Changed
- Moved and renamed `docs/guides/portal_agent_integration.md` to `docs/guides/agent_onboarding/global_agent_bootstrap_protocol.md` to better reflect its purpose and align with the new agent onboarding documentation structure.

## [0.4.1] - 2025-07-03
### Changed
- Refactored `docs/guides/contributor_guides/human_contributor_quickstart.md` into a narrative "Welcome Ritual" to complement `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Archived original to `docs/unclassified_review/from_archive/human_contributor_quickstart_pre_harmonization_20250703.md`.

## [0.4.2] - 2025-07-03
### Added
- Archived `docs/unclassified_review/0/source_of_truth.md` to `docs/unclassified_review/from_archive/source_of_truth_v1_pre_harmonization_20250703.md`.
