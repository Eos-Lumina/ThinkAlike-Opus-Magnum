# Outstanding Stubs, TODOs, and Drafts — Harmonization Tracker (June 2025)

This document tracks all remaining stubs, TODOs, and drafts across the ThinkAlike project. Each item is marked as:
- [ ] To be completed (specify owner or next step)
- [x] Complete or harmonized
- [~] Planned for future phase (not a blocker)

## High-Priority Stubs & TODOs
- [ ] Manifesto, Vision, User Personas: Ensure all are finalized and cross-linked in SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md
- [ ] Design Specs, Data Models, Traceability: Confirm all referenced files exist and are up to date
- [ ] Realms & Certification: Complete specs for all realms (including experimental/edge-case)
- [ ] Coding Standards, Dev Setup, Testing: Finalize and cross-link all developer onboarding docs
- [ ] Community Guidelines, Moderation, Deployment: Ensure all are mapped and accessible

## File-Specific TODOs & Drafts
- [ ] `src/swarm/implementations/eos_lumina_agent.py`: Complete agent logic, NLP, and sub-agent routing

## General
- [ ] Regularly update SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md and master_reference.md as new modules/specs are added or harmonized
