# ThinkAlike Whole Project Map & Gap Analysis

_Last updated: June 19, 2025_

<!-- NOTE: This is a high-level map and gap analysis. The canonical file index is in CANONICAL_FILE_INDEX.md. -->

This document provides a comprehensive, high-level map of the ThinkAlike project: all modules, flows, technical stack, and their interconnections. It also lists all major gaps, missing files, and incomplete flows, so you can see what needs to be built or improved.

---

## 1. High-Level System Map

- **Frontend (UI/UX):**
  - Next.js, React, Tailwind, ShadCN
  - Key folders: `app/`, `src/frontend/components/`, `docs/ui_components/`
  - Status: Some components stubbed/missing, onboarding flows draft

- **Backend (API & Services):**
  - FastAPI (Python), RESTful API
  - Key folders: `src/backend/app/`, `src/backend/app/schemas/`, `src/backend/app/routers/`
  - Status: Some endpoints missing, OpenAPI spec not unified

- **Agent/Swarm System:**
  - Custom agent framework (Python), YAML personas, orchestration
  - Key folders: `src/swarm/`, `docs/architecture/agent_framework/`
  - Status: Harmonized, but some persona YAMLs and agent migrations pending

- **Data Models & Schemas:**
  - PostgreSQL (JSONB), ERD planned
  - Key files: `docs/architecture/data_models.md`, `docs/architecture/database/database_schema.md`
  - Status: Incomplete, needs full entity mapping and diagrams

- **Economic Protocol (Chrona):**
  - Time-based currency, UBI, wallet
  - Key files: `docs/protocols/chrona_economic_protocol.md`, planned UI in `docs/ui_components/`
  - Status: Protocol in progress, wallet UI and backend integration needed

- **Trust/Onboarding Protocol:**
  - Narrative onboarding, user personas, trust UI
  - Key files: `docs/protocols/resonant_trust_protocol.md`, `docs/realms/portal/README.md`
  - Status: Flows incomplete, UI and backend integration needed

- **Governance:**
  - Decentralized, participatory, Veiled Matrix
  - Key files: `docs/realms/governance/`, `docs/realms/veiled_matrix/`
  - Status: Harmonized, some UI and docs in progress

- **Testing & Validation:**
  - Pytest, manual checklists, planned CI/CD
  - Key folders: `tests/`, `tests/testing_and_validation_plan.md`
  - Status: No unified test plan, coverage unknown

- **Documentation & Onboarding:**
  - Main docs: `README.md`, `SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md`, `CONTRIBUTOR_DASHBOARD.md`, `CANONICAL_FILE_INDEX.md`, `CONTRIBUTOR_QUICKSTART.md`, `CONTRIBUTOR_FAQ.md`, `QUICKSTART_FOR_NONDEVELOPERS.md`
  - Status: Harmonized, but some indices, onboarding, and FAQ incomplete

- **Noetica / Corpus Magnus (Research):**
  - Academic hub, meta files, research standards
  - Key folder: `docs/noetica/`, `_meta_` files to be populated

---

## 2. Major Gaps & Missing Files

- [ ] Data models, ERD, and schemas incomplete (`docs/architecture/data_models.md`, `database_schema.md`)
- [ ] Unified OpenAPI spec and protocol documentation not finished (`docs/api_specs/openapi.json`)
- [ ] Onboarding, user personas, and narrative flows incomplete (`docs/realms/portal/`, `docs/protocols/resonant_trust_protocol.md`)
- [ ] Chrona wallet UI and backend integration missing (`docs/ui_components/`, backend endpoints)
- [ ] Testing, validation, and coverage not unified or tracked (`tests/`, `tests/testing_and_validation_plan.md`)
- [ ] CI/CD, deployment, and observability not implemented (scripts, pipeline config)
- [ ] Some UI components, backend endpoints, and agent migrations in progress
- [ ] Documentation indices, onboarding, and FAQ need harmonization
- [ ] Noetica meta files are placeholders (to be filled by owner)
- [ ] Some folders may lack README/index files

---

## 3. Technical Stack Map

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind, ShadCN
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), RESTful API
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (JSONB), possible MongoDB (future)
- **AI/Agents:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, custom agent framework
- **DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes (planned), CI/CD (planned)
- **Design:** Figma/Adobe XD (mockups), Mermaid/PlantUML (diagrams)

---

## 4. Key Flows & Simulations (Gaps Noted)

- **User Onboarding:**
  - Portal Realm → Consent → Persona/Profile → Narrative Duet → Resonance Network
  - Gaps: Some UI, backend, and narrative flows incomplete

- **PCI (Persona Calibration Initiative):**
  - Consent → Profile → Symbolic Questions → Value Priorities → Narrative Share → Transparency Dashboard
  - Gaps: Some endpoints, UI, and audit flows incomplete

- **Chrona Wallet:**
  - Wallet UI → Balance/Transactions → Send/Receive Chrona → UBI Distribution
  - Gaps: UI and backend integration missing

- **Agent Flows:**
  - Agent registry → Persona loading → Orchestration → Value matching → Action
  - Gaps: Some agent migrations and persona YAMLs pending

- **Governance:**
  - Proposal → Voting → Execution → Audit
  - Gaps: Some UI and docs in progress

---

## 5. Next Steps
- [ ] Fill all major gaps and missing files (see above)
- [ ] Organize and improve structure as you go
- [ ] Only run harmonization checklist when all major gaps are filled
- [ ] Continuously update this map as the project evolves

_This map is your living reference for building, organizing, and completing ThinkAlike. Update as you fill gaps or restructure modules._
