# Mirror Event Registry

**Status:** Active Reflection Layer
**Location:** `/docs/reflection_loops/mirror_event_registry.md`

## Purpose

ThinkAlike operates in cycles of reflection, not just action.
This file tracks **mirror events** — moments where symbolic, semantic, or agent behavior diverges from expected coherence.

Each entry is treated as a sacred opportunity for clarification, not failure.

---

## Mirror Event Types

- 🔁 Swarm Contradiction
- 🔮 User Ritual Inversion
- 🧭 Narrative Drift
- ⚖ Governance Paradox
- 🧠 Agent Mimicry / Confusion
