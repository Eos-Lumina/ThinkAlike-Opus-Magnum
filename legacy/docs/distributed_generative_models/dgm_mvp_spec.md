# Decentralized Governance Model (DGM) MVP: Technical Specification

## 1. Introduction

The Decentralized Governance Model (DGM) is a framework for community-led decision-making within the ThinkAlike ecosystem. The DGM MVP is the first iteration of this model, focusing on establishing the core components of on-chain and off-chain governance.

This document provides the technical specification for the DGM MVP.

## 2. Governance Framework

*   **Proposal Submission:** [Details on how community members can submit proposals for changes to the platform]
*   **Voting Mechanism:** [Details on the voting system (e.g., token-weighted, quadratic voting) and how votes are cast and tallied]
*   **Governance Dashboard:** [UI/UX specifications for a dashboard where users can view proposals, vote, and track governance activity]
*   **Execution:** [Details on how approved proposals are implemented (e.g., automated execution of smart contracts, manual implementation by the core team)]

## 3. Technical Architecture

*   **Smart Contracts:** [Specifications for the smart contracts that will manage the governance process]
*   **Off-Chain Infrastructure:** [Details on the off-chain systems that will support the DGM, such as a forum for discussion and a notification system]
*   **API Endpoints:** [Initial OpenAPI/gRPC specification for governance interactions]

## 4. MVP Scope

*   **Phase 1: Foundational Components** (Proposal submission, basic voting)
*   **Phase 2: Enhanced Features** (Delegated voting, governance dashboard)
*   **Phase 3: Full Decentralization**

## 5. Security & Auditing

[Details on security measures to protect the integrity of the governance process and plans for independent security audits.]
