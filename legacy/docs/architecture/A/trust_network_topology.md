# 🌐 Trust Network Topology

## 1. Purpose & Vision

This document maps the symbolic, technical, and relational structure of trust within the ThinkAlike ecosystem. The Trust Network Topology is not merely a technical specification; it is the living, dynamic substrate for all reputation flows. It underpins the `Resonant Trust Protocol` and provides the architectural foundation for PET/Clarity (Privacy, Ethics, Transparency), ritualized user journeys, and the symbolic economy across all Realms.

Our vision is to model trust not as a static score, but as a **resonant graph of relationships**, a visible map of the collective soul.

## 2. Core Architectural Principles

-   **Decentralized & Emergent:** There is no central authority for trust. It is an emergent property of the network, distributed and dynamic, as defined in the `Resonant Trust Protocol`.
-   **Symbolic & Visual:** Trust is represented as a symbolic graph, visualized within the `Resonance Network Specification`. Nodes, edges, and weights correspond to meaningful, value-aligned interactions.
-   **Consent-Layered:** Trust can only be established and deepened through explicit, informed consent at every layer, in adherence with the `Sovereign Stack Protocol`.
-   **Ritualized Framing:** The building, challenging, or mending of trust is enacted through symbolic, user-facing ceremonies, as defined by the `Ritual Encoding Protocol`.
-   **Verifiable & Auditable:** All operations that modify the trust graph are cryptographically verifiable and logged within the system's immutable data layer, as specified in the `Data Architecture`.

## 3. Technical Implementation

### 3.1. The Trust Graph

The topology is implemented as a directed, weighted graph where:

-   **Nodes (`N`)**: Represent entities (individual users, Agents, Hives).
-   **Edges (`E`)**: Represent a trust relationship from one node to another.
-   **Weights (`W`)**: A multi-vector value on each edge representing the depth, context, and nature of the trust. This is not a single score but a composite of factors (e.g., shared values, successful collaborations, vouches received).

### 3.2. Graph Operations

-   **Node & Edge Creation**: Occurs only through explicit actions defined in protocols (e.g., completing an `Agreement Glyph` in the `Local Exchange Protocol`).
-   **Weight Evolution**: Trust weights evolve dynamically based on participation in rituals, fulfillment of covenants, and receipt of "Recognition Glyphs."
-   **Transitive Trust**: Trust can propagate through the network (A trusts B, B trusts C, therefore A has a basis for trusting C), but these paths are always made transparent and require user opt-in to be acted upon.

### 3.3. Data & Storage

-   The Trust Graph is stored in a decentralized graph database, ensuring resilience and user control.
-   All changes to the graph are recorded as immutable events, creating a fully auditable history of the trust network's evolution, in line with the `Data Traceability Protocol`.

## 4. Ritual Integration

-   **Ritual of Recognition**: The primary mechanism for strengthening trust edges through the exchange of Recognition Glyphs.
-   **Ritual of Restoration**: When a trust covenant is broken, the `Restorative Justice Protocol` is invoked. This ritualized process focuses on mending the graph rather than simply punishing a node.

## 5. Cross-System Dependencies

-   **Protocols**: This architecture is the direct implementation framework for the `Resonant Trust Protocol`.
-   **Realms**: The `Resonance Network` is the primary UI for visualizing and interacting with this topology.
-   **Data**: All state changes are governed by the `Data Architecture` and `Data Traceability Protocol`.

## 6. Implementation Checklist & Integration Map

### Step-by-Step Implementation Checklist

1. **Audit & Harmonize Protocols**
   - Review and merge all trust-related protocols: [Resonant Trust Protocol](../protocols/resonance/resonance_trust_protocol.md), [Restorative Justice Protocol](../protocols/governance/restorative_justice_protocol.md), [Ritual Encoding Protocol](../protocols/narrative/ritual_encoding_protocol.md), [Sovereign Stack Protocol](../protocols/identity/sovereign_stack_protocol.md), [Resonance Network Specification](../realms/resonance_network/resonance_network_specification.md).
   - **Data Traceability Protocol:** File not found at expected location. Flagged for recovery and harmonization.
   - Ensure all links in this document point to the latest, harmonized files.

2. **Finalize Data Models**
   - Define canonical Trust Graph schema in [data_models.md](../architecture/data_models.md).
   - Integrate consent and traceability models (PCIConsent, DataTraceability) for all trust operations.

3. **Integrate Ritual Flows**
   - Specify and document all trust-building and restoration rituals.
   - Link ritual flows to UI components and backend endpoints.

4. **Implement Decentralized Storage**
   - Use a decentralized graph database for trust graph persistence.
   - Ensure all changes are logged as immutable, auditable events.

5. **Unify UI Components**
   - Harmonize [Trust Badge Mosaic](../../docs/ui_components/trust_badge_mosaic.md) and Resonance Network UI for trust visualization.
   - Ensure all trust operations are surfaced in the UI with clear consent and audit trails.

6. **Enable Community Customization**
   - Modularize verification and trust-building tools for community self-governance.
   - Document how communities can extend or adapt trust mechanisms.

7. **Cross-System Integration**
   - Ensure trust flows are integrated with governance, economy (Chrona), agent systems, and onboarding.
   - Reference all dependencies in the canonical architecture map.

8. **Audit & Traceability**
   - Implement full audit endpoints for all trust-related actions.
   - Ensure users can view, modify, and revoke consent at any time.

9. **Documentation & Recovery**
   - Update all related docs and indexes ([source_of_truth.md](../../project/status/source_of_truth.md), [SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md](../../SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md), [ThinkAlike_Living_Archeology_Map.md](../../ThinkAlike_Living_Archeology_Map.md)) to reflect harmonized trust architecture.
   - Flag any missing or legacy files for recovery and harmonization.

## Harmonization Summary: Protocols & Network Integration

This topology is now harmonized with the canonical protocols and realms:

- **Resonant Trust Protocol:** Trust is a dynamic, multi-dimensional resonance, not a static score. Reputation is woven from verified interactions, value alignment, and community affirmation. User sovereignty and restorative potential are core.
- **Resonance Network Specification:** The network is a living constellation map, visualizing user nodes and their connections. All discovery and connection logic is user-initiated, consent-based, and narrative-driven. The Resonance Network is the main UI for trust graph interaction.
- **Restorative Justice Protocol:** Conflict is transmuted into growth through ritualized, consent-based processes focused on harm repair and reintegration.
- **Ritual Encoding Protocol:** All trust-building, restoration, and connection flows are framed as symbolic rituals, recorded immutably and designed for meaning and transformation.
- **Data Architecture:** All trust data is mapped to symbolic, ontological concepts and validated for integrity and provenance.

**Integration Points:**
- Trust Graph operations (node/edge creation, weight evolution) are governed by protocol actions and ritual flows.
- All changes are logged as immutable events, supporting full auditability and user control.
- UI components (Trust Badge Mosaic, Resonance Network) visualize trust and connection status, surfacing consent and audit trails.
- Community customization and modular verification are enabled for self-governance.

**Outstanding:**
- Data Traceability Protocol is flagged for recovery. All flows should reference this protocol for provenance and audit.
