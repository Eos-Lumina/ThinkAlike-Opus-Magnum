# AI Transparency Dashboard - Conceptual Overview

- **Version:** 0.1.0
- **Status:** Draft
- **Date:** 2025-06-14
- **Author(s):** GitHub Copilot (Conceptual Draft)
- **Related Documents:** [Ethical Guidelines](../ethical_guidelines.md), [Model Context Protocol Specification](../../architecture/protocols/model_context_protocol_specification.md), [Akashic Record Implementation Plan](../../architecture/data_systems/akashic_record_implementation_plan.md), [Ethical UI/UX Principles](./ethical_ui_ux_principles.md)

## 1. Purpose and Goals

The AI Transparency Dashboard is a user-facing interface designed to provide clear, understandable, and actionable insights into how Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems within ThinkAlike interact with their data, make decisions, and influence their experience. It is a cornerstone of our commitment to PET/Clarity (Privacy, Ethics, Transparency) and user sovereignty.

**Primary Goals:**

-   **Empower Users:** Give users a clear understanding of AI operations related to their account and data.
-   **Build Trust:** Foster trust by demystifying AI processes and making them auditable.
-   **Uphold Ethical Principles:** Provide tangible evidence of ethical considerations in AI design and operation.
-   **Facilitate Accountability:** Enable users and oversight bodies to review AI behavior.
-   **Support User Sovereignty:** Allow users to see how their data is used and make informed choices about their participation.

## 2. Key Features and Information Displayed

The dashboard will present information in a layered and user-friendly manner, allowing users to drill down for more details as needed.

### 2.1. Overview Section

-   **Personalized Greeting & Summary:** A brief, human-readable summary of recent AI activity relevant to the user.
-   **Active AI Agents:** A list or visual representation of AI agents that have recently interacted with the user's data or context (e.g., NarrativeEngine, ResonanceEngine, Eos Lumina, ClarityAgent).
    -   For each agent: a brief description of its purpose and general function.
-   **Data Usage at a Glance:** A high-level summary of the types of user data that AI systems have accessed or processed recently (e.g., profile information, narrative choices, interaction patterns).

### 2.2. Recent AI-Driven Events & Decisions

-   **Timeline/Log:** A chronological list of significant AI-driven events or decisions affecting the user.
    -   Examples: "ResonanceEngine suggested a connection with User X based on shared values A, B."
    -   "NarrativeEngine proposed a new story branch Y in your current Duet based on your recent choice Z."
    -   "ClarityAgent validated context object C-123 for ethical alignment."
-   **Explainability (Why?):** For each event, where feasible, provide a simplified explanation of the primary factors or data points that influenced the AI's decision or suggestion.
    -   This might involve showing key input features or rules that were triggered.
    -   Avoid overly technical jargon; use plain language and potentially visualizations.
-   **Link to Details:** Each event should link to more detailed views or relevant source data (e.g., the specific MCP context object, an entry in the Akashic Record).

### 2.3. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Insights

-   **Active Contexts:** A list of the user's active MCP context objects.
    -   For each context: its ID, purpose (e.g., "Algorithm Test Context," "Feedback Collection Context"), current state summary, and consent status.
-   **Context Flow Visualization (Conceptual):** A simplified visual representation of how context has flowed between different agents or components for a specific operation.
-   **Ethical Validation Status:** Display the ethical validation status for key context objects, including the score from ClarityAgent and any flags raised or mitigations applied.
    -   Link to the [Ethical UI/UX Principles](./ethical_ui_ux_principles.md) for understanding the scoring.

### 2.4. Data Usage Deep Dive

-   **Data Categories & AI Components:** A breakdown of which AI components or services have accessed specific categories of user data (e.g., UserValueProfile, NarrativeChoiceLog, interaction logs).
-   **Purpose of Use:** For each instance of data access, a clear statement of the purpose (e.g., "UserValueProfile used by ResonanceEngine to find potential matches").
-   **Data Retention Information:** Links to information about data retention policies for different types of data.

### 2.5. Auditability & Traceability

-   **Links to Akashic Record:** Provide direct links to relevant, filtered views of the user's portion of the Akashic Record, showing the immutable history of specific interactions or data changes.
-   **Ethical Oversight Log:** A summary of ethical checks, validations, and interventions related to the user's interactions, as recorded by the Ethical Oversight & Verification Layer.

### 2.6. Model Information (High-Level)

-   For key AI models interacting with the user (e.g., Resonance Algorithm, Narrative Engine models):
    -   A brief, non-technical description of the model's purpose and general approach.
    -   Information about when the model was last updated or reviewed.
    -   Links to any public documentation about the model's design and ethical considerations (if available).

## 3. Data Sources

The AI Transparency Dashboard will primarily draw data from:

-   **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Service:** For information on context objects, their state, ethical validation, and inter-agent communication logs (`trace_log` within MCPContextObject).
-   **Akashic Record:** For the immutable historical log of all significant events, user choices, and AI actions.
-   **Ethical Oversight & Verification Layer:** For logs related to ethical validations, bias checks, and compliance monitoring (e.g., AI Transparency Log, CoreValuesValidator logs).
-   **User & Identity Services:** For user profile information and consent status.
-   **Specific AI Services (e.g., NarrativeEngine, ResonanceEngine):** For metadata about models and potentially simplified explanations of their decision-making logic (requires careful design to expose this safely and understandably).

## 4. Potential UI/UX Elements

-   **Dashboard Layout:** Clean, intuitive, and organized with clear sections.
-   **Visualizations:**
    -   Timelines for events.
    -   Simple flow diagrams for context propagation or decision processes.
    -   Donut charts or bar graphs for data usage summaries.
    -   "Ethical Scorecards" for MCP contexts.
-   **Interactive Elements:**
    -   Clickable links to drill down into details (e.g., view a specific MCP object, an Akashic Record entry).
    -   Tooltips or pop-overs to explain technical terms or concepts in plain language.
    -   Search and filtering capabilities for the event log.
-   **Plain Language:** Prioritize clear, concise, and non-technical language throughout the dashboard.
-   **Accessibility:** Ensure the dashboard is designed to be accessible to users with disabilities.
-   **Responsive Design:** Adaptable to different screen sizes.

## 5. User Controls & Actions

From the dashboard, users should be able to:

-   **View Details:** Access more granular information about specific AI actions or data usage.
-   **Provide Feedback:** Offer feedback on the clarity of the information presented or on specific AI decisions/suggestions.
-   **Access Consent Settings:** Easily navigate to their privacy and consent management settings.
-   **Download Their Data:** Initiate a request to download relevant portions of their data (linking to existing data export functionalities).
-   **Learn More:** Access educational resources about ThinkAlike's AI, ethical principles, and data practices.
-   **Report a Concern:** If a user sees something that concerns them, provide a clear path to report it to the appropriate oversight body (e.g., Ethics Council, support team).

## 6. Integration with Other Systems

-   **MCP Context Manager:** The dashboard could be an extension or a complementary view to the `MCPContextManager` component, providing a more holistic overview of AI interactions beyond individual contexts.
-   **DataTraceability UI:** Will leverage and present data from the Akashic Record, making it more accessible and understandable.

## 7. Iterative Development

The AI Transparency Dashboard will be developed iteratively:

-   **MVP:** Start with core features like displaying recent AI events, basic MCP context information, and links to the Akashic Record.
-   **User Feedback:** Continuously gather user feedback to refine the design, clarity, and usefulness of the dashboard.
-   **Phased Feature Rollout:** Gradually add more advanced features like detailed explainability, visualizations, and deeper data usage insights.

By providing this level of transparency, ThinkAlike aims to foster a relationship of trust and collaboration between users and the AI systems that support their journey.
