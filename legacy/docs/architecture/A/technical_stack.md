## 1. Purpose

This document provides a canonical overview of the core technologies, languages, and platforms that constitute the ThinkAlike technical stack. This stack has been carefully chosen for its scalability, security, alignment with modern development practices, and its capacity to support the project's unique symbolic, ethical, and real-time interactive requirements. It serves as a primary reference for all contributors on the "Build ThinkAlike" path.

## 🟢 Core Technologies & Languages

  <br>
  <em>Infographic: The Harmonized ThinkAlike Technology Stack</em>
</div>

The following technologies represent the primary, harmonized stack for ThinkAlike development:

✅ **Backend (Orchestration & Logic Layer):**  
- **Primary Framework:** FastAPI (Python 3.10+) for high-performance, asynchronous, and clear API services. Pydantic is used for robust data validation and modeling.  
- **Supporting Services:** Node.js may be used for specific microservices (e.g., real-time websocket communication) if required.

✅ **Frontend (Symbolic Interaction Layer):**  
- **Primary Framework:** React (or Next.js for SSR/SSG) for dynamic, responsive, and component-based UI.  
- **Mobile (Future):** React Native for dedicated mobile apps, maintaining codebase coherence.

✅ **Databases (Persistence & Memory Layer):**  
- **Primary Relational Database:** PostgreSQL for structured data (users, profiles, governance, etc.).  
- **In-Memory/Cache:** Redis for caching, session management, and real-time features.  
- **Flexible Data:** PostgreSQL JSONB for semi-structured data; MongoDB may be considered for highly unstructured or experimental schemas.

✅ **AI & ML Platforms (AI & Symbolic Processing Layer):**  
- **Primary Libraries:** PyTorch and TensorFlow for custom deep learning models (NLP, symbolic reasoning, resonance calculations).  
- **Managed Services:** Google Vertex AI / Hugging Face Transformers for pre-trained models, serving endpoints, and complex ML workflows (e.g., agent personas, AI Personalized Teaching Engine).

✅ **API Architecture:**  
- **Primary:** RESTful API design via FastAPI for clear, structured frontend-backend communication.  
- **Future:** GraphQL may be explored for complex, multi-source data fetching (e.g., user profile dashboards).

✅ **Cloud & Infrastructure:**  
- **Primary Providers:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or AWS for scalable, secure hosting, database, and AI/ML services.  
- **Version Control:** Git (GitHub canonical repository).  
- **Containerization:** Docker and Kubernetes for deployment, scalability, and resilience.

✅ **Visual & Narrative Design Tools:**  
- **UI/UX Design:** Figma or Adobe XD for wireframes, mockups, and prototypes (see canonical_visual_style_guide.md).  
- **Architecture & Flow Diagrams:** Mermaid (Markdown-embedded) and PlantUML for clear architectural diagrams.

## 🧪 Testing Frameworks

- **Unit/Integration Testing:** Pytest (Python), Jest & React Testing Library (JavaScript/React).
- **End-to-End Testing:** Cypress or Playwright for UI/UX validation.

## 🔄 CI/CD & DevOps

- **Automation:** GitHub Actions (or similar) for automated testing, linting, and deployment pipelines.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform or Pulumi (if used for cloud provisioning).

## 📈 Monitoring & Observability

- **Logging:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), or cloud-native solutions.
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, or cloud provider tools.

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

- **Secret Management:** HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager.
- **Static Analysis/Linting:** Bandit (Python), ESLint (JavaScript/TypeScript).

## 📖 Documentation Tools

- **Docs Generation:** MkDocs, Docusaurus, or similar for project documentation (if used).

## 🌍 Internationalization (i18n)

- **Localization:** i18next (React) or similar libraries for global reach.

## ♿ Accessibility Testing

- **Automated Checks:** axe-core, Lighthouse for accessibility compliance.

## 📨 Message Queues/Event Streaming

- **Async Processing:** RabbitMQ, Kafka, or Google Pub/Sub for asynchronous or event-driven architecture (if used).

## 🔮 Integration with Symbolic & Conceptual Layers

This technical stack is not just functional; it is explicitly chosen and architected to serve the deeper symbolic layers of ThinkAlike:

- **Symbolic Kernel:** Implemented via the AI & Symbolic Processing Layer, where Python scripts and ML models process symbolic data, calculate resonance (IRS), and power agent behaviors.  
- **Chrona (⧖) & The Ledger:** The Persistence & Memory Layer (PostgreSQL) provides the secure, auditable ledger for all Chrona transactions, with the Orchestration & Logic Layer (FastAPI) handling business logic.  
- **Swarm Agents:** Agents are modular services/classes within the AI & Orchestration Layers, each with its own logic but communicating via defined APIs, enabling future DGM-style architectures.

## 🤖 Key AI Modules & Specifications

The following AI modules are core to ThinkAlike’s symbolic and ethical processing. Each module is documented with its purpose, integration points, and ethical considerations:

### 1. AI Bias Detection Module
- **Purpose:** Monitors and audits AI outputs for bias (gender, ethnicity, etc.).
- **Integration:** UI dashboards, AI Transparency Log.
- **Ethics:** Regular audits, transparency, user empowerment.

### 2. AI Image Style Analysis Engine
- **Purpose:** Analyzes user-uploaded images for style parameters (color, brightness, contrast) to enhance UI/avatars.
- **Integration:** UI modules, profile presentation.
- **Ethics:** Transparency, consent, bias mitigation, security.

### 3. AI Text Analysis Engine
- **Purpose:** Analyzes user-generated text for sentiment, keywords, and style using NLP.
- **Integration:** Matching/profile services, personalization.
- **Ethics:** Transparency, consent, bias mitigation, privacy.

### 4. AI Emergence Protocol
- **Purpose:** (Placeholder) Will define protocols for agent emergence and migration.
- **Status:** To be harmonized with project AI agent architecture.

*For full module specifications, see the respective documentation files in `docs/unclassified_review/from_archive/0-3 kb/`.*

## 📂 AI Module Specifications Harmonization

All key AI module documentation has been migrated and harmonized in the new `docs/ai_modules/` directory for clarity and future maintainability. Each module is documented with its purpose, integration points, and ethical considerations:

- [AI Bias Detection Module](../ai_modules/ai_bias_detection_module.md)
- [AI Image Style Analysis Engine](../ai_modules/ai_image_style_analysis_engine.md)
- [AI Text Analysis Engine](../ai_modules/ai_text_analysis_engine.md)
- [AI Emergence Protocol (Placeholder)](../ai_modules/ai_emergence_protocol.md)

Refer to these files for full specifications and implementation details. This organization supports ongoing harmonization and easier onboarding for contributors working on AI and symbolic processing layers.
