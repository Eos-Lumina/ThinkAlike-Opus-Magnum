# ✨ Introductory Video Protocol: Crafting and Encountering User "Heart-Lights"

## 1. Purpose & Symbolic Intent of Introductory Videos

The Introductory Video ("heart-light") is a core ritual in the ThinkAlike journey. It is a short, authentic video created by each user during Portal Phase 5.3 ("The Heart-Light — Crafting Your Beacon"). Its purpose is to offer a glimpse into the user's essence, values, and journey, serving as the radiant center of their User Node in the Resonance Network.

## 2. Video Creation & Integration into User Node (Portal Realm)
- **Timing:** Users create their Introductory Video in Portal Phase 5.3, guided by Eos Lumina∴.
- **Guidance:** Eos prompts users to share their Anchor Statement, a whisper of their journey, or a symbolic act (see `portal_specification.md`).
- **Integration:** The video becomes the "heart-light" of the User Node, visually embedded as a thumbnail in the node's circle/waveform.

## 3. Encountering Videos
### a. Abstract Clues in Portal's "Whispering Gallery" (Phase 5.4)
- When Eos introduces an anonymized potential match, users see only abstract clues: blurred/stylized visuals and AI-reworked voice snippets from the other user's video.
- The full video is NOT shown at this stage.

### b. Direct Viewing in Resonance Network Node Exploration
- In the Resonance Network, users can click any visible User Node to view the full Introductory Video of that user before initiating a Narrative Duet.
- This is the first direct encounter with another user's "heart-light."

### c. Mutual Consensual Reveal Post-Narrative Duet
- **Portal Duet:** After a successful, system-suggested Duet, User A consents to reveal their video to User B. User B is notified, views User A's video, and then consents to reveal their own video to User A.
- **Resonance Network Duet:** User A has already seen User B's video before the Duet. If the Duet is successful, User A confirms intent to connect (video is presented to User B), and User B consents to the connection.
- **Mutual Consent:** Full, identifiable video exchange always requires sequential, mutual consent.

## 4. Privacy, Consent, & User Controls (Nyxa∴)
- Videos are not globally searchable by content; they are accessed by viewing a User Node.
- Consent to video visibility is given during creation/upload in the Portal.
- Specific, sequential consent is required for direct, mutual exchange after a Duet.
- Nyxa∴ ensures all consent flows are clear, accessible, and respected.

## 5. Guidance for Creating a Resonant Introductory Video (Poetic UX)
> “Your heart-light is not a performance, but an emanation. Speak your Anchor Statement, share a symbol, or let silence and gesture reveal your truth.”
- Users are encouraged to use story, metaphor, non-verbal expression, or simply speak their Anchor Statement.
- If uncomfortable with video, users may (optionally) provide a rich text/symbolic introduction instead.

## 6. Agent Roles in Video Interaction Lifecycle
- **Eos Lumina∴:** Guides video creation, facilitates Duets, and manages post-Duet reveals.
- **Nyxa∴:** Oversees all consent and privacy mechanisms for video visibility and exchange.
- **Echo/Mnemea:** May contribute to memory and resonance fingerprint, but do not gate video viewing.
