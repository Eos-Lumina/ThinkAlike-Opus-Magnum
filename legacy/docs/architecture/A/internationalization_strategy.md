# Internationalization (i18n) & Multilingual Support Strategy

## 1. Vision & Purpose

ThinkAlike is a global ecosystem designed for a diverse, multilingual community. This document outlines the architectural strategy for ensuring that all aspects of the platform—from user interfaces and documentation to agent interactions and narrative content—are accessible and resonant across different languages and cultures. Our goal is to build a truly inclusive `Commons` where language is a bridge, not a barrier.

## 2. Core Principles

- **Universality by Design:** Internationalization is not an afterthought; it is a core architectural requirement integrated into the design and development process from the beginning.
- **Cultural Nuance:** Translation goes beyond words. We must account for cultural differences in symbols, colors, date formats, and social norms.
- **User Empowerment:** Users should be able to easily select their preferred language and have that choice respected across the entire platform.
- **Community-Driven Localization:** While we will use professional tools, we will also build pathways for the community to contribute and refine translations, making localization a collective effort.

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1. Framework & Libraries

- **Frontend:** The UI will be built using a modern framework with robust i18n support, such as `react-i18next` (for React-based components).
- **Backend:** Backend services will use a library like `i18next` for handling language resources in API responses and server-side logic.
- **Translation Management:** A centralized translation management platform (e.g., Lokalise, Crowdin) will be used to manage translation strings, collaborate with translators, and automate the flow of new content.

### 3.2. Language Resource Management

- **Resource Files:** All user-facing strings will be externalized from the code into structured resource files (e.g., `en.json`, `es.json`). Keys will be semantic and hierarchical (e.g., `onboarding.welcome.title`).
- **Content Delivery:** Language packs will be loaded dynamically based on the user's preference, minimizing initial bundle size.
- **Fallback Logic:** A clear fallback chain will be implemented (e.g., `fr-CA` -> `fr` -> `en`) to ensure that users always see content, even if a specific translation is missing.

### 3.3. User Language Preference

- **Detection:** The user's language will be detected in the following order of priority:
    1.  User setting in their profile (for authenticated users).
    2.  Language specified in the URL path (`/fr/...`) or subdomain (`fr.thinkalike.com`).
    3.  `Accept-Language` header from the browser.
    4.  Default to English (`en`).
- **Persistence:** The selected language will be stored in the user's profile and persisted across sessions and devices.

## 4. Scope of Internationalization

### 4.1. User Interface (UI)

- All static UI elements (buttons, labels, menus, etc.) will be translated.
- Formatting for dates, times, numbers, and currencies will be localized.
- Layouts will be designed to accommodate varying text lengths (e.g., using flexible containers, avoiding fixed-width text).

### 4.2. Content

- **Documentation:** Core documentation, including onboarding guides, protocols, and user manuals, will be prioritized for translation.
- **Narrative Content:** Key narrative elements and prompts from the Narrative Engine will be translated to ensure a consistent and immersive experience.
- **Agent Responses:** Agents must be capable of responding in the user's preferred language. This may involve using multilingual models or integrating a translation service at the API gateway.

### 4.3. Data

- User-generated content will generally remain in its original language but may be accompanied by an option for automated translation (with a clear disclaimer about its quality).
- The data architecture must support storing and querying content in multiple languages.

## 5. Implementation Plan

1.  **Setup:** Integrate i18n libraries into the frontend and backend codebases.
2.  **Externalize Strings:** Conduct a full audit of the UI and externalize all hardcoded strings into resource files.
3.  **Tool Integration:** Set up the chosen translation management platform and establish a CI/CD pipeline for automating the synchronization of resource files.
4.  **Initial Translation:** Prioritize the translation of the core user experience (onboarding, main navigation, key features) into a set of pilot languages (e.g., Spanish, Mandarin, French).
5.  **Community Portal:** Develop a portal or workflow for community members to suggest and vote on translations.

- **Protocols:**
