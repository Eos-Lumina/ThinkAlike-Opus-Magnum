## 1. Purpose and Goals

The AI Transparency Dashboard is a user-facing interface designed to provide clear, understandable, and actionable insights into how ThinkAlike's AI systems interact with user data, make decisions, and influence the user experience. It is a cornerstone of our commitment to PET/Clarity (Privacy, Ethics, Transparency) and user sovereignty.

**Primary Goals:**

-   **Empower Users:** Give users a clear understanding of AI operations related to their account and data.
-   **Build Trust:** Foster trust by demystifying AI processes and making them auditable.
-   **Uphold Ethical Principles:** Provide tangible evidence of ethical considerations in AI design and operation.
-   **Facilitate Accountability:** Enable users and oversight bodies to review AI behavior.
-   **Support User Sovereignty:** Allow users to see how their data is used and make informed choices about their participation.

## 2. Key Features and Information Displayed

The dashboard will present information in a layered, user-friendly manner, allowing users to drill down for details as needed.

### 2.1. Overview Section

-   **Personalized Greeting & Summary:** A brief, human-readable summary of recent AI activity relevant to the user.
-   **Active AI Agents:** A list or visual representation of AI agents that have recently interacted with the user's data or context (e.g., `NarrativeEngine`, `ResonanceEngine`, `ClarityAgent`).
    -   For each agent: a brief description of its purpose and a link to its detailed specification.
-   **Data Usage at a Glance:** A high-level summary of the types of user data AI systems have accessed or processed recently.

### 2.2. Recent AI-Driven Events & Decisions

-   **Timeline/Log:** A chronological, searchable, and filterable log of significant AI-driven events affecting the user, sourced directly from the **Akashic Record**.
    -   Examples: "ResonanceEngine suggested a connection with User X based on shared values A, B."
    -   "NarrativeEngine proposed a new story branch Y based on your recent choice Z."
-   **Explainability (Why?):** For each event, provide a simplified explanation of the primary factors that influenced the AI's decision.
    -   This will involve showing key input features from the relevant **Model Context Protocol** object.
-   **Link to Details:** Each event will link to its immutable entry in the **Akashic Record** and the specific MCP context object used.

### 2.3. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Insights

-   **Active Contexts:** A list of the user's active MCP context objects.
    -   For each context: its ID, purpose, current state summary, and consent status.
-   **Context Flow Visualization (Conceptual):** A simplified visual graph of how context has flowed between different agents for a specific operation, derived from the `trace_log` in MCP objects.
-   **Ethical Validation Status:** Display the ethical validation status for key context objects, including the score from `ClarityAgent` and any flags raised or mitigations applied, with links to the **Ethical UI/UX Principles** for understanding the scores.

### 2.4. Data Usage Deep Dive

-   **Data Categories & AI Components:** A breakdown of which AI components have accessed specific categories of user data (e.g., `UserValueProfile`, `NarrativeChoiceLog`).
-   **Purpose of Use:** For each instance of data access, a clear statement of the purpose, as defined in the component's specification.

### 2.5. Auditability & Traceability

-   **Direct Akashic Record Access:** Provide a user-friendly interface to directly query and view the user's portion of the **Akashic Record**, showing the immutable history of specific interactions.
-   **Ethical Oversight Log:** A summary of ethical checks, validations, and interventions related to the user's interactions, as recorded by the Ethical Oversight & Verification Layer.

## 3. Data Sources

The AI Transparency Dashboard will draw data primarily from:

-   **Akashic Record:** The source of truth for all historical events and interactions.
-   **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Service:** For real-time information on context objects, their state, and ethical validation.
-   **Agent & Realm Specifications:** To provide descriptive information about AI components and their purposes.
-   **User & Identity Services:** For user profile information and consent status.
