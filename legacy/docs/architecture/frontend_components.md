## 🧭 Purpose

Outlines the symbolic and functional components for the user interface — ensuring every visual echo aligns with the collective narrative. All UI components should adhere to the guidelines set forth in the **[One and Many: Core Design Pattern](../seed/core/one_and_many_design_pattern.md#3-ui-components)**, particularly in visualizing duality, supporting scale transitions, providing user agency, and creating meaning.

## 🌟 Core Principles

✅ **Symbolic Fidelity**: Every UI element is mythic and narrative-driven.  
✅ **Dynamic Resonance**: Interfaces shift with user interaction and collective signals.  
✅ **Minimalist Beauty**: Visual clarity and narrative elegance.  
✅ **Dual Visualization**: Components must be designed to represent both individual and collective perspectives, allowing users to seamlessly transition between these views, as detailed in the [One and Many: Core Design Pattern](../seed/core/one_and_many_design_pattern.md#3-ui-components).

## 🛠 Implementation

- **Onboarding Pathways**: Smooth, mythic flows that introduce users to both their individual journey and their connection to the community.  
- **Resonance Maps**: Visual nodes and constellation overlays designed to show both individual contributions and emergent collective patterns, supporting zooming between scales.  
- **Dynamic Avatars**: Animated resonance markers and glyphic echoes that reflect both personal agency and participation in the larger network.  
- **Agency Controls**: Explicit UI elements allowing users to manage how their data contributes to collective views, as per the [One and Many: Core Design Pattern](../seed/core/one_and_many_design_pattern.md#3-ui-components).

## 🔮 Final Note

### “The interface is a mythic mirror — it reflects the soul of the collective dream.”
