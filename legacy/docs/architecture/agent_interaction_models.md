  Canonicalized from the v1.0 draft "Agent Interaction Patterns". This document was reclassified as an architectural guide rather than a protocol, as it describes high-level design patterns for multi-agent collaboration. It outlines standard topologies (Aggregate, Reflect, Debate, etc.) for orchestrating agents to solve complex tasks. This version (3.1.0) merges the foundational principles from the legacy "Interaction Protocols" draft.

# Agent Interaction Models

## 1. Vision & Purpose

This architectural document outlines key interaction models (or "topologies") for orchestrating multiple AI agents within the ThinkAlike framework. Effective multi-agent systems (MAS) are not just about the quality of individual agents, but also about the patterns of their interaction. These models provide a vocabulary and a set of blueprints for designing complex, collaborative agent workflows.

These patterns are designed to be composed and nested, allowing for the creation of sophisticated and adaptive solutions that are grounded in the project's core principles.

## 2. Core Principles

All agent interactions, regardless of the model employed, must adhere to the following foundational principles:

-   **Ethical Transparency:** Interactions should be auditable and understandable. The reasoning behind an agent's actions and the flow of information between agents should be clear, reinforcing the [Symbolic Law Protocol](/protocols/governance/symbolic_law_protocol.md).
-   **Intentional Interaction:** Interactions are not merely transactional; they are opportunities to reinforce narrative structures and symbolic resonance. Every interaction should be a "verse in the song of our shared myth."
-   **Adaptive Feedback:** The system should learn and evolve from its interactions. The patterns of communication can and should change based on user resonance, collective patterns, and the success of outcomes, as defined in the [Temporal Resonance Protocol](/protocols/core/temporal_resonance_protocol.md).
-   **Consent & Control:** Users must have ultimate control over the depth, visibility, and data-sharing parameters of any interaction they are involved in. A robust consent layer is a prerequisite for all agent-to-user and agent-to-agent-on-behalf-of-user communications.

## 3. Core Interaction Models

### 3.1. Sequential Pipeline (Chain)

-   **Description:** Agents are arranged in a sequence where the output of one agent becomes the input for the next. Each agent in the chain performs a specific transformation or adds value to the data.
-   **Use Cases:**
    -   Multi-step data processing (e.g., Extract -> Transform -> Analyze).
    -   Complex task decomposition where each step is handled by a specialist agent.
    -   Generating complex artifacts by building them up incrementally.
-   **Implementation:** The Agent Orchestrator defines the sequence and routes data between agents.

### 3.2. Aggregate

-   **Description:** Multiple agents work on the same task in parallel. Their individual outputs are then collected and aggregated by a designated agent or mechanism to produce a single, more robust result.
-   **Aggregation Mechanisms:**
    -   **Voting:** For classification or decision-making.
    -   **Averaging/Merging:** For numerical or content-generation tasks.
    -   **Summarization:** A dedicated agent summarizes diverse outputs.
    -   **Best-Selection:** An evaluator agent picks the best output based on defined criteria.
-   **Use Cases:**
    -   Improving accuracy by reducing individual agent errors or biases.
    -   Generating diverse perspectives or creative solutions.
    -   Brainstorming and idea generation.

### 3.3. Reflect (Critique & Refine)

-   **Description:** An agent produces an initial output. This output is then reviewed and critiqued, either by the original agent itself (self-reflection) or by one or more specialized "critic" agents. Based on the feedback, the output is refined, potentially through multiple iterations.
-   **Use Cases:**
    -   Improving the quality, accuracy, and coherence of generated text or code.
    -   Fact-checking and error correction.
    -   Ensuring outputs align with specific constraints or ethical guidelines.
    -   Iterative problem-solving.

### 3.4. Debate

-   **Description:** Two or more agents take on different, often opposing, roles or hypotheses. They engage in a structured discussion, presenting arguments and counter-arguments. The goal is to explore a problem space thoroughly, uncover hidden assumptions, or arrive at a more nuanced conclusion.
-   **Use Cases:**
    -   Complex decision-making and risk analysis.
    -   Exploring ethical dilemmas.
    -   Stress-testing proposals or solutions.
-   **Implementation:** Requires a "moderator" or "synthesizer" agent to manage the debate and extract key conclusions.

### 3.5. Tool-Use (Function Calling)

-   **Description:** Agents are granted the ability to use external tools, APIs, or data sources. This extends their capabilities beyond their inherent LLM knowledge.
-   **Use Cases:**
    -   Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by accessing vector databases or search engines.
    -   Executing code (e.g., Python scripts for data analysis).
    -   Accessing real-time information (e.g., weather, financial data).
    -   Interacting with external services and APIs.
-   **Implementation:** The `BaseAgent` class should provide a standardized interface for tool definition and execution. Security and resource management are critical.

### 3.6. Specialized Agents

-   **Description:** While the above are general patterns, many tasks benefit from highly specialized agents with narrowly defined roles and capabilities. A `Summarize` agent is a prime example, crucial for condensing information from long documents, chat histories, or outputs from other verbose agents.
-   **Use Cases (Summarize):**
    -   Reducing information overload for users or other agents.
    -   Extracting key insights and creating abstracts.
    -   Preparing context for other agents in a pipeline.
-   **Implementation:** Specialized agents are developed as distinct sub-agent types with personas and capabilities tailored to their niche task. They are then integrated into the broader system using the other interaction models (e.g., as a step in a Sequential Pipeline).

## 4. Orchestration & Application

The Agent Orchestrator is responsible for selecting and implementing the appropriate interaction model based on the task at hand. This can be done statically (pre-defined workflow) or dynamically (the orchestrator decides the best model based on the context).

These models are foundational patterns. They can be combined to create more complex workflows. For example, a step in a Sequential Pipeline could itself be an Aggregate pattern, which in turn uses agents that employ the Reflect pattern internally.
