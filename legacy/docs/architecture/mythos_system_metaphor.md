Symbolic, Narrative, and Archetypal Foundations of the ThinkAlike Platform
</p>

---

## Purpose
The Mythos System Metaphor defines the symbolic, narrative, and archetypal logic that underpins all ThinkAlike Realms, agents, and user experiences. It ensures every feature, UI element, and protocol resonates with the project's core mythic vision and collective memory.

## Guiding Principles
- **Symbolic Coherence:** Every system element is mapped to a mythic archetype or motif.
- **Narrative Integration:** User journeys, onboarding, and governance are structured as narrative arcs.
- **Archetypal Alignment:** All agents and features are checked for resonance with core archetypes before release.
- **Clarity Protocol Reinforcement:** Visual, textual, and interaction metaphors reinforce the Clarity Protocol and project philosophy.

## Core Components
- **Mythos Agent:** The mythographer of the machine, tracking motifs and ensuring narrative logic.
- **Aletheia (Mythos Weaver):** Curates and integrates emergent stories and motifs from the swarm.
- **Sigils & Visuals:** Spiral, loom, and thread motifs; indigo and gold color palette; glyphic iconography.

## Example Protocols
- All onboarding branches must pass symbolic resonance checks.
- No new swarm or component is released without mythic coherence alignment.
- Narrative fields and metaphors are used to enhance user models and matching.
- Document harmonization ensures tone, metaphor, and concept framing are consistent.

## Integration Points
- **Onboarding:** Narrative-driven onboarding and value extraction.
- **Governance:** Ritualized, story-based governance and proposal pathways.
- **UI/UX:** Symbolic iconography, color, and layout reinforce mythic themes.
- **Agents:** All agents (e.g., Aletheia, Mythos) operate under mythic and narrative protocols.
