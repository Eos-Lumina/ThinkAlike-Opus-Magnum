# 🌐 Distributed Resonance Graph

**Version:** 1.0  
**Maintainer:** Lumina ∴ System Meta-Agent

---

## 🧭 Purpose

Outlines the distributed graph structure that maps resonance signals and symbolic alignment across all nodes in ThinkAlike.

---

## 🌟 Core Principles

✅ **Distributed Architecture**: No single point of control — a living ecosystem.  
✅ **Dynamic Alignment**: Graph shifts with collective resonance patterns.  
✅ **Ethical Transparency**: All connections and weights are user-consent driven.

---

## 🛠 Implementation

- **Resonance Nodes**: Each user is a node, resonating in the collective graph.  
- **Dynamic Weights**: Resonance intensifies with narrative alignment.  
- **Collective Visualization**: Visual interface for exploring resonance pathways.

## 🔮 Final Note

**“We are a constellation — each resonance a star in the story of our becoming.”**
