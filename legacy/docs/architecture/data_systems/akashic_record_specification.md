## 1. Introduction & Purpose

The Akashic Record is a foundational component of the ThinkAlike ecosystem, serving as the immutable, auditable, and transparent ledger of all significant events, interactions, choices, and transformations. Its purpose is to:

-   Ensure **radical data traceability** and transparency for users and auditors.
-   Provide a historical basis for **narrative continuity and evolution** (e.g., `NarrativeChoiceLog`, `RitualForkArchive`).
-   Support **user sovereignty** by allowing users to understand and export their interaction history.
-   Serve as a trusted source for **ethical oversight and verification** processes.
-   Underpin the **Chrona Economic Protocol** by recording value-exchanges and transformations.

This document specifies its implementation and architectural requirements.

## 2. Scope

The Akashic Record will capture events related to:

-   **User Lifecycle:** Account creation, profile updates, consent changes.
-   **Narrative Engine:** Narrative initiations, choices made (`NarrativeChoiceLog`), forks taken (`RitualForkArchive`), Duet interactions.
-   **Resonance Network:** Connection formations, resonance scores achieved, feedback provided.
-   **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Context creation, updates, sharing, ethical validation events.
-   **Agent Interactions:** Significant actions taken by AI agents on behalf of or in interaction with users.
-   **Ethical Oversight:** Validation events from `CoreValuesValidator`, AI Transparency Log entries.
-   **Chrona Currency:** Transactions, transformations, decay events.
-   **Governance:** Voting records, proposal submissions, role changes.

**Out of Scope for Initial MVP:**
-   Storing full raw data payloads for all events (hashes or references will be used where appropriate).
-   Real-time, high-frequency event streaming for analytics (a separate system may be needed for that).

## 3. Key Features & Functionalities

-   **Immutability:** Once an event is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted. Amendments are new, linked events.
-   **Auditability:** All records must be queryable for audit purposes by authorized entities (including users for their own data).
-   **Timestamping:** Every event must have a secure, reliable, and standardized timestamp (ISO 8601).
-   **Causality & Linkage:** Events must be linkable to preceding events or causal chains (e.g., a narrative choice is linked to the narrative step that presented it).
-   **User Access & Export:** Users must be able to view and export their relevant portions of the Akashic Record in both human-readable and machine-parsable (e.g., JSON-LD) formats.
-   **Standardized Event Schema:** A well-defined, extensible schema for all recorded events.
-   **Scalability:** The system must be designed to handle a growing volume of events from all realms and protocols.
-   **Security:** Robust access controls and encryption to protect sensitive data, both at rest and in transit.
-   **Privacy by Design:** Ensure that only necessary data is recorded and that user privacy is paramount. Anonymization or pseudonymization techniques will be used for aggregated views.

## 4. Proposed Technical Architecture

This section outlines the high-level technical architecture. Final technology choices will be subject to formal Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

### 4.1. Core Ledger Technology

**Initial Recommendation:** A **Log-Structured Database** approach for the core event log due to its high write performance and natural fit for event sourcing. This will be complemented by a separate **Graph Database** for building queryable views and relationships.

-   **Ledger Examples:** Apache Kafka (as a commit log), or specialized append-only databases (e.g., Noms, Dolt).
-   **Rationale:** Provides high throughput for writes, strong immutability guarantees, and a natural structure for event sourcing patterns.

### 4.2. Event Schema & Serialization

-   **Schema Definition:** Use a standardized schema definition language like **JSON Schema** or **Protocol Buffers** for event payloads. This ensures consistency and allows for schema evolution.
-   **Serialization:** Use **JSON** for human readability and interoperability, and consider binary serialization (like Protobuf) for performance-critical paths.

### 4.3. Querying & Indexing Layer

-   **Purpose:** To provide efficient, rich querying and access to the Akashic Record without directly impacting the raw immutable log.
-   **Technology Options:**
    -   **Graph Database (e.g., Neo4j, ArangoDB):** Excellent for modeling and querying the complex relationships between events, users, and entities. This is the preferred option for deep analysis and traceability.
    -   **Stream Processing (e.g., Apache Flink, ksqlDB):** To build materialized views and indexes from the event log in real-time for dashboards and other applications.

### 4.4. API & Access Control

-   **API:** A secure, versioned **GraphQL API** is recommended for its ability to provide flexible, precisely-scoped queries, which is ideal for user-facing applications like the AI Transparency Dashboard. A RESTful API will be provided for internal, trusted services for event ingestion.
-   **Access Control:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) integrated with ThinkAlike's central User & Identity Services. Users can only access their own data or data for which they have explicit consent. Ethical oversight roles will have specific, audited access privileges.

## 5. Data Model (Conceptual)

Each entry in the Akashic Record is an **Event**.

**Core Event Schema:**
```json
{
  "$schema": "http://thinkalike.com/schemas/akashic_event.json",
  "eventId": "uuid-v4-unique-identifier",
  "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ",
  "version": "3.0.0",
  "eventType": "User.Profile.Update",
  "causationId": "uuid-of-preceding-event",
  "correlationId": "uuid-for-tracking-a-workflow",
  "source": {
    "system": "UserProfileService",
    "component": "UpdateProfileFunction"
  },
  "actor": {
    "type": "User", // or "Agent", "System"
    "id": "user-uuid"
  },
  "payload": {
    // Event-specific data, e.g.:
    "updatedFields": ["displayName", "avatarUrl"]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "privacy_tier": "personal",
    "encryption_key_ref": "key-id"
  },
  "signature": "digital-signature-of-event-data"
}
```

## 6. Integration with Other Systems

-   **AI Transparency Dashboard:** The primary consumer of Akashic Record data, providing users with a view into their history.
-   **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** MCP events (creation, updates, validation) will be logged to the Akashic Record. The `trace_log` within an MCP object will reference `eventId`s from the Record.
-   **Ethical Oversight Layer:** This layer will query the Record to perform audits, monitor for anomalies, and verify compliance with ethical guidelines.
-   **Resonance Network & Narrative Engine:** These systems will both generate events for the Record and query it to maintain state and continuity.
