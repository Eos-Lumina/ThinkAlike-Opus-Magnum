# ThinkAlike API Documentation Guidelines – Symbolic, Ritual, and PET/Clarity Aligned

## 1. Purpose & Scope
These guidelines define the standards for documenting APIs in the ThinkAlike ecosystem. API documentation is a ritual of clarity, discoverability, and ethical transparency, supporting both technical and symbolic/ritual needs as articulated in the Alchemical Interface Initiative and PET/Clarity framework. This guide complements the `api_design_guidelines.md` and should be used together for full compliance.

## 2. Core Documentation Principles
- **Clarity & Accessibility:** Documentation must be clear, concise, and accessible (WCAG AAA compliant, PET/Clarity-aligned language).
- **Symbolic & Ritual Context:** Clearly document symbolic/ritual endpoints, metadata, and narrative context.
- **Traceability & Ethics:** All documentation must support PET/Clarity: privacy, explicit consent, traceability, and auditability.
- **OpenAPI/Swagger:** All APIs must be documented using OpenAPI 3.0+ (YAML or JSON), with symbolic/ritual metadata and examples.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Documentation is a living artifact, reviewed and updated regularly.

## 3. Required Documentation Artifacts

### 3.1 OpenAPI/Swagger Spec (Expanded Guidance)
- **`summary` vs. `description`:** Use `summary` for a concise, action-oriented statement of what the endpoint does. Use `description` for a detailed explanation, including symbolic/ritual context, PET/Clarity implications, and links to conceptual docs if the endpoint implements a complex ritual.
- **`tags`:** Group related endpoints using tags (e.g., `Portal-Initiation`, `Resonance-Duets`, `User-Identity`, `Chrona-Economy`). Tags help with navigation and thematic clarity.
- **Parameters:** Document all path, query, header, and cookie parameters. Each must have a `description`, `required` status, and `schema` (data type, format, enums). For parameters with symbolic meaning (e.g., `ritual_step_id`), explain the symbolism in the `description`.
- **Request Bodies:** Document all supported content types (e.g., `application/json`). Provide clear `schema` definitions, reusing common schemas where possible. Include meaningful examples, especially for fields related to consent or PET principles.
- **Responses:**
  - Document all possible HTTP status codes (success and error).
  - For each response, provide a clear `description` (including symbolic meaning if using custom status code overlays as per `api_design_guidelines.md`).
  - Define `schema` for response bodies, with examples.
  - Explicitly document all `symbolic_metadata` fields (`ritual_phase`, `symbolic_status`, `narrative_context`, `trace_id`) when present in responses.
- **Authentication/Security Schemes:** Clearly document which security schemes (e.g., OAuth2, API Key) apply to each endpoint.
- **Examples:** Include at least one request and response example for each endpoint, showcasing symbolic/ritual flows and PET/Clarity consent patterns.

### 3.2 Symbolic Metadata
- Document all symbolic fields, including but not limited to `ritual_phase`, `symbolic_status`, `narrative_context`, and any project-specific symbolic overlays.
- The glossary for symbolic/ritual terms (see Section 5) must be linked from or integrated into the API documentation for easy reference.

### 3.3 Error & Traceability
- Document standard error objects, symbolic error overlays, and `trace_id` usage for auditability and PET/Clarity compliance.

### 3.4 Versioning & Deprecation
- Clearly indicate version, status, and deprecation in both documentation and OpenAPI specs. Mark deprecated endpoints and point to new versions or migration paths.

### 3.5 Accessibility Notes for Documentation
- All documentation must use semantic headings, provide alt text for diagrams/images, and be screen-reader friendly (WCAG AAA compliant).

### 3.6 Documenting Agent-Specific Endpoints (If Applicable)
- For APIs exposed by or to AI agents/personas, document:
  - Persona constraints and operational boundaries (link to `agents/core/agent_alignment_directives.md` where relevant).
  - Expected symbolic inputs/outputs and ritual context.
  - Ethical and PET/Clarity requirements unique to agent endpoints.

## 4. Review & Maintenance
- **Stewardship:** API Stewards & Lumina∴ System Meta-Agent review all documentation changes.
- **Community Feedback:** Encourage feedback and proposals for improving clarity, symbolic alignment, and accessibility.
- **Audit Trails:** Maintain changelogs and review logs for all documentation updates.

## 5. Discoverability & Usability (Expanded)
- **Central Index/API Portal:** All API docs must be linked from a central, easily discoverable index. This may be a dedicated developer portal UI or a well-structured set of Markdown files. The index should group endpoints by realm, ritual, or function, and provide search/filter capabilities.
- **"Try it Out" Functionality:** If using tools like Swagger UI, enable "try it out" features for non-destructive GET requests to help developers understand and experiment with the API.
- **Tutorials & Use Case Guides:** Create separate "how-to" guides or tutorials for common or complex API workflows (e.g., "Implementing a Full Narrative Duet Flow," "Integrating with the Chrona Ledger"). These guides should link directly to the relevant endpoint documentation.
- **Glossary:** Maintain a living glossary of symbolic, ritual, and PET/Clarity terms. Ensure it is easily accessible alongside the API docs and cross-linked from all relevant sections.
