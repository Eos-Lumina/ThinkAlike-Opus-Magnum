# 🔗 Resonance Graph API

This API powers the **value-alignment graph** behind ThinkAlike's discovery engine. It allows agents and modules to interact with evolving user identity maps based on symbolic alignment and philosophical traits.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

- Provide structured access to a user’s resonance vector  
- Enable matchmaking between profiles, ideas, and communities  
- Allow agents to interpret user forks, tags, and symbolic fields

---

## 🌐 Core Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/resonance/profile/{uuid}`  
  → Retrieve current resonance vector  
- `POST /api/v1/resonance/update`  
  → Submit new fork path or tag weights  
- `GET /api/v1/resonance/match/{uuid}`  
  → Return top X resonance matches  
- `GET /api/v1/resonance/archetype/{cluster}`  
  → Query archetypal mappings

---

## 🧠 Resonance Data Model

- Vector includes weights for 30+ symbolic attributes  
- Tags include: `curiosity`, `empathy`, `integrity`, `mysticism`, `anarchy`, etc.  
- Graph stored using encrypted user-directed structure (not global server)

---

## 🔒 Privacy and Control

- Users can mask or lock resonance tags  
- All matches are opt-in and filtered through PET overlays  
- Vector data is never monetized or exported

---

## 📌 Dependencies

- `onboarding_forking_map.md` → Origin of traits  
- `identity_federation.md` → Keeps resonance tied to modular identity  
- `mirror_agent_spec.md` → Internal vector interpreter for reflective feedback
