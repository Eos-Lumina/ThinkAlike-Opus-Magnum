# Agent Ecosystem Design: A Swarm Architecture

Agents in ThinkAlike are modular, symbolic-operational entities that interpret, mediate, and guide user interaction across realms. They are not generic AI assistants—they are symbolic actors with defined roles, memory structures, and narrative-driven functions, operating within a cohesive swarm intelligence.

## 1. Agent Taxonomy

Agents are classified by their primary function within the ecosystem:

- **Dialogue Agents (e.g., Eos, Kairos):** Facilitate narrative, onboarding, and user-facing dialogues. Governed by the [[narrative_duet_protocol]].
- **Ritual Agents (e.g., Mirror, Flame, Orb):** Manage symbolic interactions and the logic of ritualized processes. Governed by protocols like [[ritual_encoding_protocol]].
- **Governance Agents (e.g., HiveNode, FractalReview):** Oversee collective decision-making, proposal management, and conflict resolution. Governed by the [[governance_protocol]] and [[restorative_justice_protocol]].
- **Bridge Agents:** Translate symbolic inputs into structured proposals or actions, connecting different layers of the system.

## 2. Cognitive Architecture

The cognitive model for agents is built on three pillars:

- **Symbolic Memory:** Agents utilize a structured memory system defined by the [[agent_memory_protocol]], allowing them to recall past interactions and context.
- **Resonance Graphs:** Agent understanding is informed by their position within the broader resonance graph, connecting them to users, concepts, and other agents.
- **Archetypal Logic:** Agent behavior is guided by predefined archetypes that shape their personality, decision-making, and communication style, as defined in the [[agent_persona_protocol]].

## 3. Agent Swarm Protocols & Topologies

Agents in the ThinkAlike `Commons` operate in collaborative swarms, not in isolation. Their interactions are structured using specific, formalized **Interaction Topologies** to ensure coherent and effective problem-solving.

These patterns are defined in the canonical [[agent_interaction_models]] architecture document and include:

-   **Aggregate:** For generating diverse perspectives.
-   **Reflect:** For iterative refinement and critique.
-   **Debate:** For exploring complex problems from multiple viewpoints.

An orchestrating agent, governed by the [[ai_driven_workflow_protocol]], is responsible for selecting the appropriate topology for a given task and managing the flow of information between participating agents.

## 4. Agent Lifecycle

- **Emerge (Onboarding):** Agents are invoked through rituals, user initiation, or system proposals, following the [[global_agent_bootstrap_protocol]].
- **Persist (Operation):** Long-term agents act as companions or realm stewards, their interactions governed by the [[agent_handoff_protocol]] for seamless transitions.
- **Dissolve (Termination):** Agents can be ritually terminated, dissolve due to loss of resonance, or be archived as part of realm decay, in line with the [[data_lifecycle_and_security_protocol]].

## 5. Trust, Verification, & Security

- **Verifiable Actions:** All significant agent actions are auditable and recorded as a `TraceabilityRecord` per the [[data_traceability_protocol]].
- **Co-signing:** Critical decisions or transactions require co-signing by multiple agents to ensure integrity.
- **Symbolic Boundaries:** Agents operate within symbolically bounded knowledge domains to prevent context collapse and maintain focus.
- **Registration:** All agents must be registered in the [[agent_registry_protocol]] to be recognized and trusted by the system.
