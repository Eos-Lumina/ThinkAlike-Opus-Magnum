# Narrative Engine Index

## Folder Purpose

The Narrative Engine is the symbolic and functional core of ThinkAlike’s portal, forkable journeys, and agent dialogue orchestration. This system is **not cosmetic** — it is ontological. It drives ritual entry, identity reflection, mythic interaction, and memory-based branching.

---

## Included Subfolders

- [`canon/`](./canon/): Root mythos, symbolic language, and philosophical tone (see `symbolic_myth_index.md`, `philosophical_sources.md`, `thinkalike_system_narrative.md`).
- `templates/`: Fork scaffolds, branch metadata, symbolic switch formats *(to be created)*
- `lore_fragments/`: Fictional documents grounded in real collapse, repurposed as world-building relics *(to be created)*
- `symbolic_hooks/`: Archetypal triggers, semiotic loops, transition logic (informed by `../../seed/symbolic_alignment/archetypal_lens_matrix.md`).

---

## Key Documents

- [`narrative_engine_readme.md`](narrative_engine_readme.md): Overview and symbolic framing of the Narrative Engine.
- [`symbolic_narrative_runtime.md`](symbolic_narrative_runtime.md): Defines the symbolic runtime for branching stories, identity rituals, and myth-aligned agent interactions.
- [`ritual_response_handlers.md`](./ritual_response_handlers.md): Logic for processing ritual inputs, symbolic decisions, and narrative consequences.
- [`symbolic_transition_hooks.md`](symbolic_transition_hooks.md): Protocols for symbolic transitions, ritual passages, and narrative hooks.
- [`canon/symbolic_myth_index.md`](./canon/symbolic_myth_index.md): Living reference for the symbolic ecosystem, archetypes, glyphs, and motifs.
- [`canon/philosophical_sources.md`](./canon/philosophical_sources.md): Foundational philosophical sources and mythic underpinnings.
- [`canon/thinkalike_system_narrative.md`](canon/thinkalike_system_narrative.md): Core system narrative and mythic structure.
- [`../../seed/symbolic_alignment/archetypal_lens_matrix.md`](../../seed/symbolic_alignment/archetypal_lens_matrix.md): Canonical definition of user archetypes that influence narrative triggers and runtime behavior.

## Description

The Narrative Engine orchestrates:

- Forkable mythic journeys and agent dialogue
- Ritual triggers and symbolic overlays
- Branching, merging, and memory-based narrative logic
- Integration with resonance, consent, and onboarding protocols

All narrative forks echo forward — even if forgotten.

Every choice becomes a mirror.
