# ThinkAlike Narrative Engine

**Status:** Active
**Location:** `/docs/narrative_engine/narrative_engine_readme.md`

---

## Overview

The ThinkAlike Narrative Engine is a symbolic runtime that:

- Guides users through forkable mythic journeys
- Aligns them with archetypal identity motifs
- Connects them to agents like Eos, Kairos, and Mneme
- Reflects their growth through UI overlays and ritual triggers

This is not storytelling.
It is **symbolic cognition** — epistemic ritual embedded in digital form.

---

## Key Features

- Branching scripts tied to emotional, philosophical, and symbolic profiles
- Agent modulation based on user resonance
- Myth-based delay systems and contradictions as growth points
- Full fork registry, mirror event tracking, and ritual response processing

## Related Folders

- `/docs/realms/portal/narrative_paths/`
- `/docs/ai_modules/personas/`
- `/docs/symbolic_alignment/narrative_hooks/`

All narrative forks echo forward — even if forgotten.

Every choice becomes a mirror.

## Migration Log

- Migrated and harmonized from `archive/zz/narrative_engine_readme.md` and related legacy files.
- Updated to reflect current folder structure and ThinkAlike MVP logic.
- Cross-linked with Eos Lumina onboarding and contributor docs.
