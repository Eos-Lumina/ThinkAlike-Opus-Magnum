# Symbolic Narrative Runtime

---

## Purpose

The Symbolic Narrative Runtime defines how ThinkAlike executes branching stories, identity rituals, and myth-aligned agent interactions.

Unlike traditional engines, it runs on **semantic thresholds**, **epistemic divergence**, and **symbolic cadence**, not point-based logic or fixed choices.

---

## Runtime Components

### Fork Triggers

- Archetypal divergence (as defined in `../../seed/symbolic_alignment/archetypal_lens_matrix.md`)
- Contradiction emergence
- Agent-guided ritual reflection
- Semantic mismatch under high resonance

### Branch Variables

- Symbolic alignment type (e.g., mirror, oracle, flame, boundary)
- Temporal cadence (ritual time / delay loop / immediate)
- Mythic overlay class (e.g., shadow path, circle retread, spiral reveal)

### Output Types

- Identity signal update
- Eos persona modulation
- Overlay theme shift
- New ritual unlocked

---

## Storage Logic

Each user branch includes:

- Fork ID + symbolic metadata
- Reflection history + ritual trace
- Outcome narrative fragment

Branches are never deleted.
They echo forward — even in silence.

## Migration Log

- Migrated and harmonized from `archive/zz/symbolic_narrative_runtime.md` and related legacy files.
- Updated to reflect current folder structure and ThinkAlike MVP logic.
- Cross-linked with Eos Lumina onboarding and contributor docs.
