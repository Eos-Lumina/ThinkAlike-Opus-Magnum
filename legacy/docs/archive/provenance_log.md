-   **Action:** `CANONIZE FROM CONCEPT`
-   **Date:** 2025-06-17
-   **Source Files (Legacy - Missing):**
    - `docs/unclassified_review/selection/temporal_dynamics.md`
    - `docs/unclassified_review/selection/temporal_dynamics_module.md`
-   **Destination File:** `docs/architecture/temporal_dynamics_protocol.md`
-   **Rationale:** The original legacy files were missing. This new canonical document was generated by distilling the core principles of "Temporal Dynamics" from the Genesis Packet. Its creation formally resolves the status of the two missing legacy artifacts.
