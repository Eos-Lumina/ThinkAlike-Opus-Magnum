# Code Style & Ethical Implementation Guide – ThinkAlike

## 1. Introduction: Achieving "Perfect Coding" – Ritual over Interface, Alchemical Craft

This Code Style Guide provides comprehensive guidelines for code formatting, style conventions, and best practices within the ThinkAlike project. Adherence to these guidelines is **mandatory** for all code contributions, ensuring a codebase that is not only functionally robust but also demonstrably clear, maintainable, and ethically sound.

ThinkAlike is committed to the principle of "Perfect Coding," which extends beyond mere technical correctness to encompass ethical considerations, user empowerment, and transparency. This guide supports the "Ritual over Interface" and "Alchemical Interface Initiative" by ensuring the underlying vessel (the code) is crafted with intention, clarity, and symbolic resonance.

This guide is intended for all developers contributing to the ThinkAlike project, encompassing both human contributors and AI agents. Consistency in coding style is paramount for facilitating collaboration, enhancing code readability, and ensuring the long-term maintainability and scalability of the ThinkAlike platform. Furthermore, adherence to these guidelines directly contributes to the transparency and auditability of the codebase, leading to greater user trust and confidence.

## 2. General Code Style Conventions

- **Python:** Strictly adhere to the [PEP 8 style guide for Python code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). Key aspects:
  - 4 spaces per indentation level.
  - Line length: 79 for code, 72 for comments/docstrings.
  - Blank lines for logical separation.
  - Clear, descriptive naming for variables, functions, classes, modules.
  - Comprehensive comments and docstrings.
- **JavaScript (React):** Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and [React/JSX Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react).
  - 2 spaces for JS/JSX indentation.
  - Use functional components and React Hooks.
  - Descriptive, self-explanatory naming.
  - Modular/component-based architecture.
  - Clear separation of concerns.
  - Comprehensive comments and code annotations.
- **Markdown:**
  - Use clear, hierarchical headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.).
  - Bullet points/numbered lists for clarity.
  - Code blocks for code/config/CLI examples.
  - Consistent link formatting and descriptive link text.
  - Professional, clear tone throughout.
  - Use ThinkAlike metadata block format for new `.md` spec docs.

## 3. Ethical Coding Considerations: Embedding Values into Code Implementation

- **Transparency and Explainability:**
  - Prioritize code clarity/readability over excessive optimization.
  - Use meaningful, descriptive names for all code elements.
  - Include comprehensive comments/annotations, especially for symbolic intent or when implementing features with deep symbolic meaning. Link to relevant Corpus Magnus docs where appropriate.
- **Data Privacy and Security by Design:**
  - Robust input validation and data sanitization.
  - Follow OWASP Top Ten and security best practices.
  - Secure data storage/encryption for data in transit and at rest.
- **Bias Mitigation and Fairness in Algorithms:**
  - Employ bias detection/mitigation throughout AI lifecycle.
  - Use fairness metrics and algorithmic auditing.
  - Prioritize algorithmic transparency and explainability.
- **User Empowerment and Control Embodied in Code:**
  - Clear, intuitive APIs and data access mechanisms.
  - UI components/settings for granular privacy and data control.
  - User-centric design principles.
  - **Error Red:** All error feedback mechanisms in UI (even if triggered by backend code) should use Error Red (`#FF4136`) for clarity, as defined in UI component specs.

## 4. Document Location and Filename

- **File Name:** `code_style_guide.md`
- **Canonical Folder:** `docs/style/`

## 5. Symbolic Naming Conventions (The Alchemical Lexicon)

To ensure the codebase reflects ThinkAlike's unique symbolic, ritualistic, and mythopoetic domain language:

- **Purpose:** Guide naming of variables, functions, classes, components, and database entities that relate to core symbolic/ritual concepts.
- **Guiding Principles:**
  - **Clarity & Evocativeness:** Names should be understandable to developers and carry symbolic meaning where appropriate.
  - **Consistency:** Use terms from `symbolic_myth_index.md` and the project glossary.
  - **Context is Key:** Use highly symbolic naming for modules/functions implementing rituals or core symbolic logic (e.g., Portal Realm, Narrative Engine, Resonance Logic).
- **Examples/Patterns:**
  - **Ritual Functions:** Prefix with `ritual_` or use evocative verbs (e.g., `ritual_forge_initiation_glyph()`, `invoke_narrative_duet()`, `channel_oracle_response()`).
  - **Symbolic Data Structures:** Use names reflecting symbolic nature (e.g., `class InitiationGlyphParameters`, `interface ResonanceFingerprintDimension`).
  - **Agent-Related Code:** Prefix with agent name or signifier (e.g., `eos_lumina_dialogue_manager`, `AICloneResponseGenerator`).
  - **States/Phases:** Use narrative terms (e.g., `current_portal_phase = 'WHISPERING_GALLERY'`).
  - **Database Entities:** Use symbolic names (e.g., `ritual_choice_log`).
- **Guidance:** When naming elements central to ThinkAlike's conceptual framework, strive for names that are both technically clear and resonant with deeper meaning. Consult `symbolic_myth_index.md` and realm specs for terminology. For generic utility code, use standard clear naming.

## 6. Tools & Automation for Style Enforcement

- **Python:** Black, Flake8, MyPy
- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** ESLint, Prettier
- **Pre-commit hooks:** Automate formatting/linting
- **Project Scripts:** `scripts/dynamic_docs_update.py`, `scripts/agent_persona_manager.py` support documentation and persona consistency
