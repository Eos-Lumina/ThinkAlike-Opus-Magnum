# AI Image Style Analysis Engine Spec – Discerning the Aura of Images

## 1. Introduction & Symbolic Framing
The AI Image Style Analysis Engine is not merely a tool for extracting color palettes. It is a system for **discerning the aura** and **symbolic resonance** of an image, designed to understand a user's aesthetic and symbolic preferences. This enriches the "Aesthetic Field" of their `Resonant Self` (Resonance Fingerprint) and can influence the visual feel of their interactions (e.g., the colors of their "Epistemic Garden" visualization).

**Strict Scope:** This engine does **NOT** perform facial recognition, object detection for labeling people/places, or any form of surveillance. Its focus is purely on abstract aesthetic and symbolic patterns.

## 2. Inputs
- Profile avatars
- Images shared in Dream Offering Rituals
- Media uploaded to Hives or the Noetic Forge
- Every input must be accompanied by a `consent_id` from the `ConsentLog` for this specific analysis.

## 3. Processing Logic (The Alchemical Gaze)
- **Layer 1: Aesthetic Analysis (The 'Exoteric' View):**
  - Extract dominant color palettes (hex values)
  - Assess overall brightness (dark, balanced, bright)
  - Measure contrast level (low, medium, high)
  - Detect dominant texture (organic, geometric, fluid, etc.)
- **Layer 2: Symbolic Analysis (The 'Esoteric' View):**
  - Using models trained on art history, mythology, and the `symbolic_myth_index.md`, attempt to identify the presence of archetypal symbols (e.g., "mandala," "spiral," "tree motif," "eye").
  - This is a pattern-matching process for symbols, not an interpretation of their meaning.

## 4. Outputs (The Distilled Aesthetics & Symbols)
The output is a structured object for the `UserValueProfile`:
```json
{
  "trace_id": "uuid-for-transparency-log",
  "source_image_hash": "sha256-of-the-image",
  "analysis_results": {
    "aesthetic_profile": {
      "dominant_palette_hex": ["#1A2B3C", "#F0EAD6", "#C4A484"],
      "overall_brightness": "dark",
      "contrast_level": "high",
      "dominant_texture": "organic"
    },
    "symbolic_signals": [
      { "symbol_id": "SYM_MANDALA", "confidence": 0.85 },
      { "symbol_id": "SYM_SPIRAL", "confidence": 0.70 }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 5. Integration
- The structured output is used by the **`UserValueProfile` Service** to update the "Aesthetic Field" and "Symbolic Overlap" dimensions of a user's "Resonance Fingerprint."
- The `dominant_palette_hex` may be used to theme a user's `ProfileCard` or other UI elements, creating a visually resonant experience.
- All operations are logged via the `ai_transparency_log_guide.md`.

## 6. Ethical Considerations (Crucial Section)
- **Explicit Consent:** No image is analyzed without specific, granular consent for this purpose.
- **Strict Purpose Limitation:** The engine is for aesthetic/symbolic profiling for resonance, not for identification, tracking, or surveillance. This must be stated unequivocally.
- **Bias Mitigation:** All models must be rigorously tested for biases, especially those related to cultural artifacts and skin tones (in the context of color palette analysis, not recognition), as per the `ai_bias_detection_guide.md`.
- **User Control:** Users can view and delete their analysis results from their profile via a Data Explorer Panel.

## 7. Security, Privacy, and Transparency
- All image data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- Strict access controls are enforced.
- All analysis events and results are logged for transparency and auditability.
- Users can view and delete their analysis results via the Data Explorer Panel.

This specification supersedes the legacy `ai_image_style_analysis_engine.md` and is the canonical reference for all future development and harmonization efforts.
