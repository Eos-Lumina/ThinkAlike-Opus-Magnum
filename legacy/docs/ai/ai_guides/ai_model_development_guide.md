# AI Model Development Guide

## 1. Introduction
This guide is the unified reference for developers working on Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for ThinkAlike. It outlines key principles, ethical considerations, recommended frameworks, workflow, requirements, and UI integration strategy for AI model development.

AI in ThinkAlike enhances user experience, fosters authentic connections, guides self-discovery, and promotes ethical data practices. AI models are designed as collaborative, human-augmenting tools, always aligned with the project's core values: authenticity, empowerment, transparency, and PET/Clarity.

**See also:** [ThinkAlike Manifesto](../vision/manifesto.md), [Ethical Guidelines](../ethics/ethical_guidelines.md)

---

## 2. Core Principles for AI Model Development
- **Ethical AI by Design:** Integrate ethical considerations at every stage (data, model, deployment, monitoring).
- **Transparency & Explainability:** Prioritize interpretability, auditability, and UI-driven clarity. Avoid "black box" AI.
- **User Empowerment & Agency:** AI augments human decisions, never replaces or dictates. UI must enable user control.
- **Data Privacy & Security:** Anonymization, encryption, and access control are mandatory. UI must validate privacy.
- **Bias Mitigation & Fairness:** Actively detect and address bias. Strive for fairness and inclusivity.
- **Value Alignment & Ethical Validation:** Continuous UI-driven validation and monitoring for ethical alignment.
- **Human-Centered Design:** AI must enhance genuine human connection and value-driven outcomes.
- **Continuous Validation:** Use UI as a real-world validation and feedback loop for all AI outputs.

---

## 3. Recommended Frameworks & Libraries
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** NLP, text generation, sentiment analysis, narrative engine.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** General ML, deep learning, custom neural networks, image/video processing.
- **PyTorch:** Research, prototyping, and advanced ML tasks.
- **Scikit-learn:** Classical ML, data preprocessing, model evaluation.

---

## 4. Workflow & Best Practices
1. **Define the Problem & Ethical Context:** Reference the Manifesto and Ethical Guidelines.
2. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Ensure privacy, consent, and bias mitigation.
3. **Model Design & Training:** Use explainable architectures; document all choices.
4. **Evaluation:** Test for accuracy, bias, and ethical alignment. Use UI-driven validation.
5. **Deployment:** Integrate with UI for real-time feedback and user control.
6. **Monitoring & Continuous Improvement:** Use user feedback and UI analytics for ongoing validation.

---

## 5. UI Integration & Validation
- All AI outputs must be validated through reusable UI components.
- UI must display data usage, transformations, limitations, and potential biases.
- Users must have control over AI settings and recommendations.
- UI serves as the primary feedback and validation loop for ethical and value alignment.

## 7. Harmonized Requirements & Ritual Process (2025-06-11 Addendum)

This section incorporates the distilled guiding principles from the Harmonization Addendum (2025-06-11) and the Ritual of Coherent Distillation:

### Ethical Alignment & PET/Clarity
- All AI work must explicitly align with Enlightenment 2.0 principles: Human Dignity, Ethical AI, Transparency, User Empowerment, and Radical Democracy.
- PET/Clarity (Privacy, Ethics, Transparency) is non-negotiable. All models must:
  - Protect user data (privacy by design)
  - Be explainable and auditable (transparency)
  - Undergo ethical review before and after deployment

### Swarm Agent Proposal & Development Process
- **Proposal:** Submit a new agent proposal using the canonical template (see `/src/swarm/canonical_specs/agent_registry.md`).
- **Review:** Proposals are reviewed for ethical alignment, technical feasibility, and PET/Clarity compliance.
- **Development:** Follow best practices for modular, testable, and maintainable code. Use version control and document all design decisions.
- **Integration:** New agents must pass all tests and ethical audits before being integrated into the Swarm.

### Technical Standards
- **Versioning:** Use semantic versioning for all models and agents.
- **Testing:** Achieve 80%+ test coverage (unit, integration, and end-to-end). Integrate tests into CI/CD workflows.
- **Deployment:** Use containerization (Docker) and maintain reproducible environments. All deployments must be documented and traceable.

### Bias Detection, Transparency, and Explainability
- Implement bias detection and mitigation strategies for all models (see `/docs/guides/developer_guides/ai/ai_bias_detection_guide.md`).
- Use explainability tools (LIME, SHAP, attention mechanisms) and document model decision logic.
- Maintain a public catalog of all active models and agents, including:
  - Model/agent name and description
  - Ethical considerations and bias mitigation
  - Data sources and training documentation
  - Architecture and algorithmic details
  - Performance metrics and evaluation results
  - Links to code and documentation

### Ritual Process for Agent Integration
- All new agents must undergo the "Ritual of Coherent Distillation":
  - Ethical review and audit
  - PET/Clarity compliance check
  - Community feedback and public scrutiny
  - Formal registration in `/src/swarm/canonical_specs/agent_registry.md`

### Ongoing Review & Auditing
- All models and agents are subject to periodic ethical audits and performance reviews.
- The public catalog must be kept up to date.
- Any model found to violate PET/Clarity or ethical standards must be immediately withdrawn and reviewed.
