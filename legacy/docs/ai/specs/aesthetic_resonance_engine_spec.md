# Aesthetic Resonance Engine Specification

## 1. Purpose & Symbolic Role

The **Aesthetic Resonance Engine** is an AI module designed to decipher the user's expressed **"Aesthetic Field"** (as defined in `symbolic_resonance_fields.md`) by analyzing the visual qualities of their self-representative media (e.g., their Introductory Video, profile avatar, or consensually shared symbolic images).

Its primary purpose is **NOT** to perform identity recognition or psychological profiling. Instead, its function is to generate a set of aesthetic parameters that can be used to:
*   Subtly attune the user's visual presence within ThinkAlike (e.g., the aura of their User Node, the procedural generation of their Epistemic Garden) to their own stylistic sensibilities.
*   Contribute a nuanced layer to the `identity_resonance_score.md` (IRS), allowing for the possibility of matching based on shared or complementary aesthetic languages.
*   Create a more harmonious, personalized, and symbolically resonant visual experience for the user.

Symbolically, this engine acts as a **"Mirror of Form,"** reflecting the user's sense of beauty, style, and visual language back to them and into the system's aesthetic ecosystem.

## 2. Expected Inputs

*   `mediaSource`: A direct reference to a user's media file (e.g., Introductory Video, avatar image) provided via a secure internal pipeline.
*   `sourceContext`: Enum, e.g., 'IntroductoryVideo', 'ProfileAvatar', 'DreamOfferingImage'.
*   `userId`: For associating the generated aesthetic profile.
*   `consentFlags`: An object confirming explicit user consent for *this specific type of aesthetic analysis* for the purpose of *visual personalization and resonance calculation*. This consent must be logged in the `ConsentLog`.

## 3. Core Processing Logic & Aesthetic Feature Extraction

The engine utilizes image and video processing libraries (e.g., OpenCV, Pillow, scikit-image) to analyze visual data without interpreting its semantic meaning in a personal way.

*   **Basic Visual Parameters:**
    *   **Dominant Color Palette:** Extracts a palette of the most prominent and harmonious colors.
    *   **Brightness, Contrast, Saturation:** Calculates average levels for these standard visual metrics.
*   **Aesthetic Style Indicators:**
    *   Performs analysis to classify the overall visual style into abstract, non-judgmental categories. Examples:
        *   `Minimalist` vs. `Dense/Complex`
        *   `Organic/Naturalistic` vs. `Geometric/Structured`
        *   `Vibrant/Energetic` vs. `Muted/Contemplative`
        *   `Abstract/Ethereal` vs. `Concrete/Literal`
*   **Compositional Analysis:**
    *   Identifies core compositional traits such as 'Symmetrical', 'Asymmetrical', 'Rule of Thirds', or 'High Texture'.
*   **Symbolic Motif Recognition (Advanced - Experimental):**
    *   A future capability to identify the presence of visual patterns that strongly resemble core glyphs from the `symbolic_myth_index.md` (e.g., spirals, stars, branching patterns, circles, triangles). This must be handled with care to avoid over-interpretation.

## 4. Expected Outputs (Structured JSON)

The engine produces a structured JSON object representing the user's aesthetic profile. This object is stored as part of their extended `UserValueProfile` or "Resonance Fingerprint."

```json
{
  "trace_id": "uuid_for_this_analysis_event",
  "analysisTimestamp": "iso_datetime",
  "sourceContext": "IntroductoryVideo",
  "aesthetic_profile": {
    "dominant_colors_hex": ["#1a2b3c", "#c4a484", "#e4dcd3"],
    "brightness_avg": 68,
    "contrast_avg": 52,
    "saturation_avg": 45,
    "dominant_style_indicators": ["Contemplative", "Organic"],
    "compositional_traits": ["Asymmetrical", "Low_Contrast"],
    "identified_symbolic_motifs": ["branching_form"]
  },
  "confidence_score": 0.82
}
```

## 5. Integration & Systemic Role

- **UserValueProfile / "Resonance Fingerprint":** The aesthetic_profile output directly populates and enriches the "Aesthetic Field" dimension of the user's Resonance Fingerprint.
- **identity_resonance_score.md (IRS):** Contributes to the IRS calculation, enabling resonance matching based on shared or complementary aesthetic sensibilities.
- **User Node Visualization (Resonance Network):** The output can directly influence the procedural generation of a user's visual presence. The dominant_colors_hex could inform the color palette of their waveform or aura. dominant_style_indicators could influence the animation style (e.g., a smooth, slow pulse for 'Contemplative').
- **epistemic_garden.md Visualization:** The visual style of a user's Epistemic Garden could be procedurally generated or themed based on their aesthetic profile, making their inner world's representation more personally resonant.

## 6. Ethical Considerations & PET/Clarity

- **Transparency & Consent:** Users must be explicitly informed that their uploaded video/images will be analyzed for aesthetic style and color palettes for personalization and resonance purposes. They must provide opt-in consent. The purpose is clearly stated, and users can see the outcome (e.g., "Your dominant aesthetic seems to be 'Contemplative & Organic'") in their detailed profile.
- **Strict Prohibition of Psychometric Profiling:** Crucially, this engine MUST NOT be used to make psychological judgments or personality inferences based on visual choices. A preference for 'Muted' colors does not imply a user is melancholic. The analysis is strictly about visual style for the purpose of visual and aesthetic attunement. This is a hard-coded ethical boundary.
- **Bias Mitigation:** Image analysis models are notoriously prone to bias. The models used for style and composition analysis must be rigorously tested as per ai_bias_detection_guide.md on diverse datasets to ensure they do not perform differently or generate biased classifications based on skin tone, cultural artifacts, or other protected characteristics present in the images/videos.
- **User Control & Deletion:** Users must have the ability to view a representation of their inferred aesthetic profile, disable its use in personalization/matching, and request the deletion of the generated aesthetic_profile data.

## 7. Development & Maintenance

This engine must be developed and maintained according to the overarching principles defined in the ai_model_development_guide.md, including continuous monitoring for drift and regular ethical audits.

## 8. Technical Implementation Notes

-   **Core Libraries:** The engine will primarily be built in Python, leveraging established image processing libraries such as **OpenCV** and **Pillow** for foundational tasks like color palette extraction, brightness, contrast, and compositional analysis.
-   **Symbolic Mapping:** Advanced symbolic motif recognition will require custom logic and potentially models trained on art history and the project's `symbolic_myth_index.md`.
-   **Service Architecture:** The engine should be implemented as a modular, containerized microservice, callable by other backend services via a well-defined API, ensuring scalability and separation of concerns.
