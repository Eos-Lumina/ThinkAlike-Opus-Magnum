# AI Orchestration & Workflow Patterns (Canonical)

## 1. Purpose & Scope
This guide defines how AI orchestrates, automates, and validates transformative workflows across the ThinkAlike platform. It unifies technical, ethical, and symbolic perspectives—showing how AI, agents, and UI collaborate to create meaningful, transparent, and PET/Clarity-aligned user experiences.

## 2. Core Principles
- **AI as Alchemical Collaborator:** AI modules are not just tools, but active co-creators—guiding, validating, and evolving user journeys and system processes.
- **Orchestration of Realm Flows:** AI engines (NarrativeEngine, ResonanceEngine, AIClonePersonaEngine, future DGMs) orchestrate the unfolding of core realms: Portal (Initiation Journey), Narrative Duets, Resonance Network, and beyond.
- **Agent Mediation:** Agents like Eos Lumina∴ serve as the user-facing voice and ritual guide, embodying the system’s ethical, symbolic, and narrative intent.
- **PET/Clarity & Symbolic/Ritual UX:** All workflows are designed to maximize Privacy, Ethics, Transparency, and to support symbolic, ritual, and transformative user experiences.
- **UI as Validation & Revelation:** The UI is the primary instrument for surfacing, validating, and making transparent all AI-driven processes and data flows.
- **Data Traceability:** Every workflow ensures data is traceable, auditable, and understandable, with the UI providing actionable feedback and visualization.

## 3. Orchestration Patterns in Restored Realm Flows
### 3.1 Portal Journey (Initiation – Alchemical Unfolding)
- **AI Role:** The NarrativeEngine and AIClonePersonaEngine guide the user through the 6-phase Initiation Journey, as defined in `realms/portal/portal_specification.md`, forging the Initiation Glyph, Invocation Phrase, and UserValueProfile.
- **Agent:** Eos Lumina∴ narrates, interprets, and validates each ritual step, surfacing PET/Clarity and symbolic meaning.
- **Workflow Diagram:**
  ```mermaid
  graph LR
      subgraph "User Realm (UI)"
          U[User] --> UI[Portal UI]
      end
      subgraph "Agent & AI Layer"
          EL[Eos Lumina∴ Agent]
          NE[NarrativeEngine]
          CE[AIClonePersonaEngine]
      end
      subgraph "Data & Validation Layer"
          DB[(UserValueProfile, Glyph, Invocation)]
          DT[DataTraceability & Akashic Record]
      end

      U --Makes Choice / Provides Input--> UI
      UI --Sends Action to--> EL
      EL --Invokes Narrative Step--> NE
      NE --Provides Next Scene/Dilemma--> EL
      EL --Queries for Persona Insights--> CE
      CE --Returns Persona-driven response--> EL
      EL --Delivers Narration & UI Update Command--> UI
      NE --Updates User Profile--> DB
      DB --Logs Event--> DT
  ```
### 3.2 Narrative Duets (Ritual of Resonance)
- **AI Role:** The NarrativeEngine and AIClonePersonaEngine co-orchestrate the CYOA-style compatibility test as detailed in protocols/narrative_duet_protocol.md.
- **Agent:** Eos Lumina∴ mediates, narrates, and ensures PET/Clarity and symbolic resonance.
- **Workflow:** Similar to the Portal Journey, but involves a two-persona interaction model (the user and the AI Clone), with outcomes directly influencing the Resonance Network.

### 3.3 Resonance Network (Exploration – Ritual of Seeking)
- **AI Role:** A conceptual ResonanceEngine orchestrates constellation navigation, node reveals, and Narrative Duet invitations, as per realms/resonance_network/resonance_network_specification.md.
- **Agent:** Eos Lumina∴ and supporting agents guide, explain, and validate user actions within the network.

## 4. Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Error Handling:** Workflows must include robust error handling, with agents like Eos Lumina∴ providing user-facing, symbolically aligned error messages (e.g., "A thread was lost in the weave, let us try again.").
- **State Management:** The orchestration layer is responsible for persisting the state of long-running workflows (e.g., a multi-day Narrative Duet).
