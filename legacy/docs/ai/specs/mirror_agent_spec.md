# 🪞 Mirror Agent Specification

The Mirror Agent is an AI swarm component that reflects users’ symbolic decisions, forks, and narrative traits during onboarding and matching. It enables self-insight, poetic mirroring, and symbolic alignment.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

- Present reflective prompts based on user onboarding decisions  
- Expose unseen patterns, contradictions, or strengths  
- Enable guided self-awareness without judgment or diagnosis  
- Help users refine their resonance vectors

---

## 🔍 Key Capabilities

- Symbolic pattern interpretation from onboarding forks  
- Trait-matching narrative loops (e.g., “You tend toward integration over control…”)  
- Ability to surface resonance edge cases or user paradoxes  
- Contributes to resonance vector clarity and onboarding joy

---

## 🧠 Example Output (After Fork #3)

> “You seek to dismantle what dominates — yet you hesitate at disorder. Your architecture is not built — it emerges.”
