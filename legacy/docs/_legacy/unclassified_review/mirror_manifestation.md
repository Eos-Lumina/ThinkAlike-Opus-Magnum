## 🧭 Purpose

Mirror Manifestation is a speculative module where user-generated forks, reflections, and symbolic intents **generate system suggestions or prototypes**. This bridges imagination and implementation — allowing onboarding choices and dream forks to spawn real proposals, modules, or features.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Intent-to-Module Pipeline**  
  Users’ reflections in Mirror Mode or Dream Fork Engine can be translated into working proposals for new modules or AI swarm experiments.

- **Fork-Based Suggestion Engine**  
  The system observes patterns in user forks and proposes corresponding symbolic modules or community hives.

- **Manifestation Journal**  
  Users can track symbolic ideas as they move toward reality — or remain poetic.

- **Safeguarded Symbolic Boundaries**  
  PET overlays prevent abuse, fantasy-gamification, or harmful externalization.
