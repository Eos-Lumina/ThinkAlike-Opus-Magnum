## 🧭 Purpose

Mirror Mode is a reflective extension of the onboarding journey. It allows users to explore alternate versions of themselves, replay narrative forks, and analyze identity evolution. It’s a safe dreamspace to witness symbolic patterns and consider possible future paths — without surveillance, judgment, or gamification.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Replay Past Forks**  
  Watch the stories you once walked. Branches you never took are revealed as ghost echoes.

- **Symbolic Self Comparison**  
  View alternate versions of your identity tree based on what-ifs.

- **Aesthetic Reflection Engine**  
  Reframe your onboarding path through visual, poetic, or narrative mirrors.

- **Future Self Scenarios**  
  Imagine paths you haven’t walked yet, based on matching archetypes or intention sets.

- **Consent-Held Processing**  
  All reflections happen inside PET shells. Nothing leaves without your blessing.
