## ðŸŒ» Joyful Resistance Manifesto

## ðŸ“œ The Premise

- Technology is not neutral
- Our tools shape our stories
- We refuse to be reduced to clicks, feeds, or quantifiable "value"

---

## ðŸŽ¶ Principles of Joyful Resistance

- Make beauty instead of monetization
- Architect meaning, not extraction
- Trust the edges, the poets, the hackers, the guides
- Build forks that free, not fences that bind
- Every click can be a choice of care
