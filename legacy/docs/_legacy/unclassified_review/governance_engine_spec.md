## 🏛️ Governance Engine Specification

This specification defines how decisions are made, moderated, and reversed within the ThinkAlike ecosystem. It supports both consensus-driven processes and minority voice preservation.

## 🧭 Design Principles

- Consent > control
- Visibility > authority
- Participation weighted by contribution, not capital
- Modular logic allows governance per module or across global system

---

## 🧩 Components

- **Proposal Engine**: structured decision requests
- **Voice Weighting**: balanced by past contributions (Chrona, care, effort)
- **Moderation Tools**: collective flagging + AI-assisted resolution
- **Dispute Pathways**: transparency-first fallback escalation
