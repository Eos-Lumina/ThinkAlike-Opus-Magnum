This contract defines the expected behaviors, fields, and structure of the Resonance Graph API — ThinkAlike's symbolic matchmaking layer.

---

## 📋 Required Endpoints

- `GET /resonance/profile` → return current identity vector
- `POST /resonance/update` → submit onboarding fork
- `GET /resonance/match` → return symbolic alignment match
- `GET /resonance/traits` → list of tags or trait arcs
- `DELETE /resonance/mask` → hide selected traits

---

## ⚠️ Safeguards

- All requests must be tied to consent context
- No global queries allowed
- No matching without resonance field present
- Must integrate with PET overlay logic
