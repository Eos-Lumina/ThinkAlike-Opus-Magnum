# ðŸ§  Swarm Coordination Layer

This layer describes how AI agents collaborate to construct, review, and maintain ThinkAlike documentation, decisions, and ecosystem actions.

---

## ðŸ§  Agent Roles

- `Clarity Agent` â€” standardization, structure  
- `Mirror Agent` â€” identity reflection  
- `Trace Agent` â€” logs, lineage, recovery  
- `Recovery Agent` â€” emergency restoration  
- `Coordinator` â€” delegation, disambiguation  
- `Resonance Agent` â€” trait synthesis and matching

---

## ðŸ”— Coordination Rules

- No agent operates without context (`bootstrap_alignment.md`)  
- All major decisions must go through `documentation_history.md`  
- Agents can inherit memory from prior forks, but not assume  
- Human contributors may override any outcome
