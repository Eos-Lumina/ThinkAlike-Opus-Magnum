## 💻 Fallback User Interface

Defines how ThinkAlike interfaces behave in degraded environments: offline, low bandwidth, or disabled JavaScript scenarios.

---

## 🧱 UI Modes

- ✨ Minimal Mode (pure HTML/CSS, static onboarding)
- ⏳ Capsule Replay (offline onboarding journal)
- 🛡️ PET Overlay Defaults (mask-on by default)
- 🧭 Resync Queue (for delayed merges ks)

> “No system should require perfection to function ethically.”

migration_note: Developed from Obsidian compatibility tests, no-JS fallback architecture, and accessibility reviews.
