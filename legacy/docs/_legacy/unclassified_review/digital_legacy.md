## 🧭 Purpose

This module enables users to **preserve aspects of their identity, values, and intentions** for continuity, remembrance, or community reflection — even after absence, transformation, or death. It provides a consent-based alternative to surveillance-driven data persistence.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Legacy Capsules**  
  Symbolic collections of thoughts, decisions, forks, or modules a user wants remembered or passed on.

- **PET-Governed Time Locks**  
  Capsules can be opened at user-defined events — by time, resonance, or communal rituals.

- **Heir Module Proposals**  
  Users can specify who may inherit or build upon their work, forks, or modules.

- **Clarity Testament**  
  A statement of what the user stood for in the context of the project’s philosophy.
