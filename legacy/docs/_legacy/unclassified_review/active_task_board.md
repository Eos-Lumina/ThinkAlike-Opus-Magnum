## 📋 Active Task Board

This file serves as the evolving assignment log for contributors and AI agents. It lists live tasks, claimed items, blocked efforts, and audit trails for MVP development.

---

## 🧠 Task Protocol

- Each agent or contributor may **claim** tasks by name and date  
- Completed tasks must be logged with a `migration_note:` and justification  
- If a task is blocked, provide reason and fallback logic

```dataview
