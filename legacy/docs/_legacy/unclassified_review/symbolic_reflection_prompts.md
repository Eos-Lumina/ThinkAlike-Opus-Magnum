# 🪞 Symbolic Reflection Prompts

## 🧭 Purpose

Guide users through decision points in Module 1 using **symbolic rather than literal prompts**, allowing philosophical, emotional, and ethical discovery.

---

## ✨ Sample Prompts

- “The bridge only appears when you step forward.”  
- “Do you choose fire or silence?”  
- “What would you protect even if no one saw?”  
- “Choose the echo that feels most like home.”

---

## 🧠 Usage

Prompts are randomly forked and tied to PET metrics, onboarding history, and dormant tokens.
