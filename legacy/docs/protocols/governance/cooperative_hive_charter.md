# üèõÔ∏è The Cooperative Hive Charter

## 1. Preamble: The Ritual of Shared Sovereignty

This Charter provides a voluntary, formal framework for any Hive within the ThinkAlike `Commons` to constitute itself as a **Platform Cooperative**. By adopting this Charter, a Hive affirms its commitment to democratic ownership, shared governance, and the equitable circulation of value, grounding its symbolic existence in real-world principles of mutual aid and collective stewardship.

This is the bridge between the *mythos* of the Hive and the *praxis* of a just digital organization.

## 2. The Seven Cooperative Principles (ThinkAlike Harmonics)

A Hive that ratifies this charter formally adopts the Seven Cooperative Principles, interpreted through the lens of ThinkAlike's ethos.

1.  **Voluntary and Open Membership (The Open Hearth):** Membership is open to all who resonate with the Hive's purpose and are willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political, or religious discrimination.
2.  **Democratic Member Control (Sovereign Member Stewardship):** The Hive is a democratic organization controlled by its members, who actively participate in setting policies and making decisions. In Hives with representative structures, stewards are accountable to the membership.
3.  **Member Economic Participation (The Flow of `Chrona`):** Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their Hive. A portion of any surplus is the common property of the Hive. This surplus shall be allocated for developing the Hive, benefiting members in proportion to their contributions, and supporting other activities approved by the membership.
4.  **Autonomy and Independence (Hive Sovereignty):** The Hive is an autonomous, self-governing organization. If it enters into agreements with other organizations, it does so on terms that ensure democratic control by its members and maintain its cooperative autonomy.
5.  **Education, Training, and Information (The Gnostic Transmission):** The Hive shall provide education and training for its members and stewards so they can contribute effectively to the development of their cooperative. They inform the general public about the nature and benefits of cooperation.
6.  **Cooperation Among Cooperatives (The Mycelial Network):** The Hive serves its members most effectively and strengthens the cooperative movement by working together through local, national, regional, and international structures.
7.  **Concern for Community (Weaving the `Commons`):** The Hive works for the sustainable development of its communities through policies approved by its members.

## 3. Ratification: The Founding Ritual

A Hive formally adopts this charter through a proposal in its own governance space. The proposal must be ratified by the consensus mechanism defined in the Hive's own rules. Once ratified, the Hive receives a **"Cooperative Hive"** verifiable credential, and this Charter becomes its binding constitution.

## 4. Membership & Roles

-   **Member:** Any Initiate who has completed the Hive's joining ritual and has been accepted according to its rules. Members hold voting rights.
-   **Steward:** A member elected or chosen through a defined process to facilitate governance, manage resources, or represent the Hive. Stewards are accountable to all members.

## 5. Governance & Voting

-   Each member receives one vote ("one member, one vote").
-   Decisions on core policies, resource allocation, and steward selection shall be made by the full membership or their elected stewards, as defined in the Hive's specific governance protocol.

## 6. Dissolution

Should the Hive choose to dissolve, any remaining common assets (Chrona or other resources) will be transferred to another cooperative entity or dedicated to the ThinkAlike `Commons` fund. They cannot be distributed for the private gain of individual members beyond their earned share.
