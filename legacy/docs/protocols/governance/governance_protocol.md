## Harmonization Note: Plain-Language Governance & Trust Guide

### Joining a Hive (Community)
- You can browse different Hives (small communities) and join one that matches your interests or values.
- Each Hive has its own purpose, members, and ways of making decisions.
- Sometimes you join instantly, other times you may need approval.

### Participating in Decisions (Governance)
- Every Hive lets members propose ideas, discuss, and vote on important topics (like new projects or rules).
- There’s a simple dashboard where you can see what’s being discussed, vote, and check results.
- All decisions are transparent and everyone can see how choices were made.

### Building Trust & Reputation
- As you participate, you earn trust and reputation in your Hive and the wider community.
- Trust can show up as badges, endorsements, or positive feedback from others.
- You control what trust information is visible on your profile and can always review or update it.

### Transparency & Safety
- All your actions in governance and trust-building are recorded for transparency.
- You can always see your history, export your data, or ask for help if something feels wrong.
- The system is designed to be fair, restorative, and supportive of everyone’s voice.

---

**Why this matters:**
- You help shape your community and make real decisions.
- Trust is earned through participation, not just numbers or scores.
- You are always in control of your reputation and privacy.

# ThinkAlike Governance Protocol

## 1. Philosophical Foundation

This protocol establishes the formal rules and procedures for collective decision-making within the ThinkAlike ecosystem. It is designed to be a living system that facilitates **homeorhesis**—a dynamic, self-correcting flow towards systemic health and ethical integrity. The protocol replaces static, top-down control with participatory stewardship, using ritualized deliberation to transmute diverse perspectives into coherent, value-aligned decisions.

## 2. Scope of Governance

This protocol applies to decisions that affect the entire ThinkAlike platform, including but not limited to:

*   Amendments to this Governance Protocol or any other canonical protocol.
*   Changes to core economic parameters as defined in the [[chrona_economic_protocol|Chrona Economic Protocol]].
*   Canonization of new realms, rituals, or core architectural components.
*   Ratification of platform-wide policies and community guidelines.
*   High-level dispute resolution and restorative justice appeals.

Decisions that are local to a specific Hive are handled by that Hive's internal governance, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.

## 3. Participant Roles & Eligibility

*   **Assembly of All Voices:** Any agent who has completed the full Portal Realm initiation and the "Civic Literacy & Ethical Stewardship" module is eligible to submit proposals, participate in deliberation, and vote.
*   **Hive Delegates:** Hives may choose to delegate representatives or vote as a collective block, as defined by their internal governance.
*   **Thematic Stewardship Circles:** Advisory bodies composed of agents with high reputation and recognized expertise in specific domains (e.g., AI Ethics, Protocol Weaving). They do not have special voting power but their analysis is formally incorporated into the deliberation record.
*   **AI Agent Facilitators (Non-Voting):** Designated AI agents (e.g., Themis Concordia∴, Aletheia Veritas∴) facilitate discussions, provide data, and ensure procedural integrity. They hold no vote and cannot author proposals.

## 4. The Governance Lifecycle: A Five-Stage Ritual

All platform-level decisions must proceed through the following five stages:

1.  **Stage 1: Invocation (Proposal Submission)**
    *   An eligible agent submits a formal proposal via the "Co-Creation Invocation" interface.
    *   The proposal must include a clear title, a detailed description of the proposed change, the rationale, and the anticipated impact.
    *   The proposal is assigned a unique identifier and entered into the public governance ledger.

2.  **Stage 2: Illumination (Deliberation)**
    *   A mandatory deliberation period begins, with a default duration of 14 days.
    *   All eligible agents may post arguments, questions, and evidence related to the proposal.
    *   AI facilitators will tag arguments, identify points of consensus and contention, and guard against logical fallacies.

3.  **Stage 3: Refinement (Amendment & Synthesis)**
    *   Based on the deliberation, the original proposer (or a designated editor) may submit a revised version of the proposal.
    *   Amendments must clearly state what has changed and why.
    *   This stage can be iterated, but each major revision resets a shorter deliberation clock (e.g., 3 days).

4.  **Stage 4: The Weaving (Decision Ritual / Voting)**
    *   Once deliberation is formally closed, a time-boxed voting period of 7 days is initiated.
    *   The default consensus mechanism is **Quadratic Voting**, where the number of votes an agent can cast on a single issue is the square of the "voice credits" they allocate to it. This allows agents to express the intensity of their preference.
    *   For certain constitutional-level changes, a supermajority (e.g., 66%) may be required.

5.  **Stage 5: The Sealing (Ratification & Integration)**
    *   If the proposal meets the required threshold, the outcome is cryptographically signed and permanently recorded on the platform's immutable ledger.
    *   The ratified change is assigned to the relevant engineering and stewardship agents for implementation.
    *   The change is considered canon and is integrated into all relevant documentation and system protocols.

## 5. Consensus Mechanisms & Voting

*   **Primary Mechanism:** Quadratic Voting (QV) is the default for most decisions.
*   **Alternative Mechanisms:** The Governance Protocol itself can be amended to allow for other mechanisms like Ranked-Choice Voting or STAR voting for specific proposal types.
*   **Voice Credits:** Each agent receives an equal, non-transferable allocation of voice credits per voting cycle to use in QV. This prevents wealth from dominating the voting process.

## 6. Transparency & Auditability

*   All stages of the governance lifecycle are public and recorded on an immutable ledger.
*   Voting records are published pseudonymously to protect individual privacy while ensuring public verifiability of the outcome.
*   A public dashboard will display the status of all proposals, voting results, and key governance metrics.

## 7. Protocol Amendments

Amendments to this Governance Protocol are considered constitutional changes and require a heightened consensus threshold:

*   **Deliberation Period:** Minimum 28 days.
*   **Voting Threshold:** 66% supermajority.
