# Governance Specification

## Purpose
To define the canonical rules, principles, and mechanisms for decision-making, participation, and accountability in the ThinkAlike ecosystem.

## Core Principles
- **Inclusivity:** All agents and contributors have the right to participate in governance processes.
- **Transparency:** All decisions, votes, and governance actions are logged, auditable, and open to review.
- **Accountability:** Roles, responsibilities, and outcomes are clearly defined and tracked.
- **Adaptability:** Governance structures and processes evolve in response to community needs and feedback.
- **Ethical Alignment:** All governance flows must align with PET/Clarity and symbolic alignment standards.

## Design Patterns
- **Role Assignment:** Clear definition and assignment of roles, permissions, and responsibilities.
- **Decision Flows:** Use context-aware consensus and delegation mechanisms (see Liquid Democracy Specification).
- **Audit Trails:** All governance actions are logged for review and accountability.
- **Safeguards:** Mechanisms to prevent abuse, ensure fairness, and support dispute resolution.
- **Symbolic Alignment:** Rituals and narratives reinforce trust, transparency, and ethical standards.

## Integration Points
- All modules, agents, and contributors must reference this specification for governance logic.
- Contributor guides and onboarding flows must explain governance principles and safeguards.
