# Simulation: Agent Interaction & Narrative Engine Flows

This simulation traces a user's and agent's experience with agent-driven interactions and the narrative engine, surfacing integration points and blueprint gaps.

---

## 1. Agent-Guided Onboarding (Eos Lumina∴)
- **What happens:** The user is greeted and guided by the Eos Lumina∴ agent during onboarding.
- **Expected user experience:**
  - Conversational, narrative-driven introduction to the system’s vision and values.
  - Personalized guidance through onboarding steps (e.g., Initiation Glyph, Invocation Phrase, Narrative Duet).
  - Ability to ask questions and receive context-aware, ethical responses.
- **Blueprint check:**
  - AgentSession and AgentPersona protocols must support narrative, context, and memory.
  - UI must provide a chat or guided flow interface.
  - All onboarding actions must be logged for traceability.

## 2. Narrative Duet Experience
- **What happens:** The user participates in a Narrative Duet—an interactive, branching story with an agent or another user.
- **Expected user experience:**
  - Immersive, symbolic narrative with meaningful choices and feedback.
  - Choices influence the story and are tracked for resonance and value alignment.
  - Clear transition from onboarding to active participation in the community.
- **Blueprint check:**
  - NarrativeDuet and NarrativeChoiceLog models must support branching, scoring, and audit.
  - UI must provide an engaging, accessible narrative interface.
  - All choices and outcomes must be logged and auditable.

## 3. Ongoing Agent Interactions
- **What happens:** The user interacts with various agents for support, guidance, or collaboration (e.g., in Hives, governance, or creative projects).
- **Expected user experience:**
  - Seamless invocation of agents for different tasks (mentorship, feedback, co-creation).
  - Transparent display of agent actions, memory, and ethical safeguards.
  - Option to review and manage agent interactions and data.
- **Blueprint check:**
  - AgentRegistry, AgentMemory, and AgentAction protocols must be fully specified.
  - UI must allow users to invoke, review, and manage agent interactions.
  - All agent actions must be auditable and reversible.

## Gaps & Recommendations
- [ ] Ensure AgentSession, AgentPersona, AgentRegistry, and AgentMemory protocols are fully specified and cross-linked.
- [ ] Complete UI specs for agent chat/guidance and narrative interfaces.
- [ ] Specify NarrativeDuet branching, scoring, and audit logic in detail.
- [ ] Add/clarify audit and traceability endpoints for all agent and narrative actions.
- [ ] Cross-link agent and narrative docs in the blueprint and protocol overview.

*Update this simulation as the blueprint evolves. Use it to validate agent and narrative flows and ensure a robust, user-friendly experience.*
