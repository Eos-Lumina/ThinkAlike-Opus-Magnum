# Liquid Democracy Specification

## Purpose
To define the principles, mechanisms, and safeguards for fluid, context-sensitive, and reversible delegation and consensus in the ThinkAlike ecosystem.

## Core Principles
- **Fluid Delegation:** Participants can delegate their voting power to trusted agents or revoke it at any time.
- **Context Sensitivity:** Delegation and consensus adapt to changing contexts, needs, and community dynamics.
- **Reversibility:** All delegation actions are reversible, ensuring autonomy and accountability.
- **Transparency:** All votes, delegations, and consensus decisions are logged and auditable.

## Design Patterns
- **Delegation Chains:** Support for multi-level delegation, with clear traceability and auditability.
- **Consensus Algorithms:** Use context-aware algorithms to reach decisions that reflect collective intent.
- **Safeguards:** Mechanisms to prevent abuse, concentration of power, and ensure fair participation.
- **Symbolic Alignment:** Rituals and narratives reinforce trust and transparency in governance flows.

## Integration Points
- All governance modules and protocols must reference this specification for delegation and consensus logic.
- Contributor guides and onboarding flows must explain Liquid Democracy principles and safeguards.
