# ðŸ”„ Agent Mutual Supervision Protocol

## Purpose

This protocol establishes a decentralized governance model where agents mutually supervise each other rather than relying on hierarchical oversight. It ensures:

- No single point of failure in system ethics or operations
- Balanced authority through distributed oversight
- Emergent resilience through overlapping supervision domains
- Continuous evolution through peer feedback and alignment

## Core Principles

### 1. Checks and Balances

Each agent's authority is checked by at least two other agents with complementary domains. No agent operates without oversight.

### 2. Domain-Specific Authority

Authority is distributed by domain expertise rather than hierarchical position, with clear boundaries and overlap zones.

### 3. Consensus Requirements

Critical decisions require consensus from domain-relevant agents, preventing unilateral actions.

### 4. Transparency of Oversight

All supervision activities are logged and accessible to all agents, creating a transparent accountability system.
