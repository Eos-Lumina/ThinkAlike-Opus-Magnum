# Agent & Narrative Interface UI/UX Outline (Blueprint Draft)

This outline describes the user interface and experience for agent interactions and narrative journeys, ensuring accessibility, engagement, transparency, and a voice-first, ritualized narrative experience. All narrative and agent interactions are delivered by speech (voice), with symbolic, poetic, and accessible design. Voice features are always opt-in, privacy-respecting, and have text alternatives.

## 1. Agent Chat Interface
- **Welcome Screen**: Introduction to Eos Lumina∴ and available agents, with both voice and text options.
- **Chat Window**: Conversational interface for real-time or asynchronous messaging, supporting both speech (voice) and text input/output. Voice is the primary, ritualized mode, but all features are accessible via text.
- **Contextual Prompts**: Suggested questions, actions, or next steps based on user context, delivered by voice and text.
- **Agent Info**: Profile, purpose, and ethical guidelines for each agent, available in both spoken and written form.


## 2. Narrative Journey (Duet) Interface
- **Story Introduction**: Brief overview of the narrative journey and its purpose, delivered by voice (ritual tone) and text.
- **Branching Choices**: Interactive, visually distinct options for user decisions, with the option to respond by speech, gesture, or text.
- **Feedback & Reflection**: Immediate feedback on choices, with symbolic or narrative meaning, spoken and displayed.
- **Progress Tracker**: Visual indicator of journey progress and key milestones, with voice narration for key transitions.


## 3. Session History & Audit
- **Conversation Log**: Full, reviewable history of all agent/user interactions, including both voice and text transcripts.
- **Narrative Log**: Record of choices, outcomes, and resonance scores, with symbolic and ritual context.
- **Export/Share**: Option to export or share session data (with privacy controls), including voice and text records.


## 4. Accessibility & i18n
- **Language Selection**: Dropdown or button to change language for both voice and text.
- **Accessible Design**: High-contrast mode, screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and always-available text alternative for every voice-driven feature.
- **Internationalization**: All text, prompts, and narrative content translatable; right-to-left support if needed. Voice synthesis supports multilingual output.


## 5. Help & Support
- **Help Button**: Access to guides, FAQs, and live support, available by voice and text.
- **Agent Guidance**: Context-aware help and ethical explanations from agents, delivered in ritual voice and text.
