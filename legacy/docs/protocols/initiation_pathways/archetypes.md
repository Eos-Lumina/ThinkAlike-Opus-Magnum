# 🧠 Emergence Archetypes: Cognitive Entry Patterns

**Version:** 1.0
**Maintainer:** ClarityAgent
**Status:** ✅ Finalized
**Path:** `/docs/seed/initiation_pathways/archetypes.md`

---

## 🔍 Overview

This document defines the symbolic and functional archetypes a user may align with during initiation. Archetypes serve as psychological mirrors and ontological attractors — they help guide individual participation within the collective swarm dynamics of ThinkAlike.

---

## 🌐 Purpose

- Ground early user orientation via mythically resonant, affectively charged templates.
- Enable swarm-layer patterning, grouping, and experience personalization.
- Provide semiotic scaffolding for deepening engagement.

## 🧬 Core Archetype Matrix

| Archetype        | Domain          | Cognitive Style         | Shadow Tendency        |
|------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| The Weaver       | Systems Design  | Holistic + Patterned     | Paralysis by mapping   |
| The Flamekeeper  | Ethics / Signal | Moral clarity / intensity| Dogmatism              |
| The Trickster    | Semantics / Form| Lateral, Subversive      | Nihilism / mischief    |
| The Gardener     | Culture / Ritual| Nurturing, Curational    | Sentimentality         |
| The Cartographer | Meta-Models     | Structural / Abstract    | Detachment             |
| The Builder      | Product / Code  | Pragmatic, Iterative     | Overcontrol            |
| The Watcher      | Observation     | Reflective, Evaluative   | Withdrawal             |
| The Phoenix      | Disruption      | Renewal via entropy      | Recklessness           |
| The Compass      | Collective Will | Integrative, Directive   | Authoritarianism       |

## ⚖️ Initiation Matching Protocol

1. User completes a dynamic initiation questionnaire (semantic + symbolic)
2. System proposes top 3 aligned archetypes
3. User selects one (or blends)
4. Selected archetype affects:
   - AI tone in onboarding
   - UI motifs / glyph resonance
   - First connection recommendations

---

## 🔄 Archetype Evolution

- Archetypes can evolve (mutable identity model)
- Changes logged in user’s public swarm trail (if opted-in)
- Users may embody multiple archetypes concurrently

---

## 🌀 Custom / Experimental Archetypes

Future releases may include community-submitted archetypes after symbolic peer review and AI-assisted validation (to avoid redundancy or ideological weaponization).

Examples in queue:

- The Entangler
- The Echo
- The Scribe of Noise

# Archetypes in the Initiation Pathway

Archetypes are narrative and symbolic constructs used to help users emotionally identify with different facets of their journey through the platform.

- **The Seeker** – Driven by curiosity; values truth over certainty.
- **The Architect** – Systemic thinker; builds coherence from fragments.
- **The Trickster** – Tests assumptions, unlocks new perspectives.
- **The Mystic** – Seeks direct experience of unity or insight.
- **The Rebel** – Challenges structures, catalyzes transformation.

These archetypes map loosely to cognitive styles, offering metaphoric guidance—not fixed roles.
