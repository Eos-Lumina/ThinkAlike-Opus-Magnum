## 🧭 Purpose

This document defines the staged onboarding journey for new ThinkAlike users, blending symbolic resonance, user intent mapping, and progressive feature exposure. The onboarding is both functional and initiatory — a rite of entry into a new paradigm of technology and consciousness.

## 🌀 Phased Journey Overview

| Phase       | Name                 | Description                                                                 |

| 1           | Harmonic Inquiry     | User answers symbolic + intent-based questions. Builds Value Profile.       |
| 2           | Archetypal Attunement| User is invited to choose a guiding archetype (or hybrid).                  |

## 🔣 Symbolic UX Elements

- **Initiation Glyphs:** Animate upon each stage completion.
- **Eos Lumina Message:** Rendered in voice/text, echoes user's stated values.
- **Clarity Score:** Reflects alignment, focus, and swarm readiness.
- **Resonance Map:** Initial visual network representation based on shared values.

---

## ✨ Behavioral Personalization

Each user interaction during onboarding informs their:

- **Value Profile** → used for connection matching.
- **Cognitive Style** → suggested swarm roles.
- **Intent Signal** → triggers agent guidance, visual hints.

---

## 🧠 Learning by Doing

The onboarding system prefers experiential activation over explanation. Micro-interactions are meaningful: e.g., selecting an archetype shifts UI tone, connection algorithm seed, and swarm suggestions.

---

## 📜 Ethical UX Principles

- No manipulation or nudging
- Opt-out at any stage
- Transparent data handling
- User sovereignty at every fork

---

## 🔄 Ongoing Evolution

Onboarding content, glyph resonance, and swarm mapping will evolve based on:

- Collective intelligence
- Behavioral feedback loops
- Community-proposed enhancements (Liquid Protocol)

## Onboarding Journey Template

A structured, ritualized onboarding experience.

- **Phase 1: Emergent Greeting**
   > "You are not alone. Your thoughts resonate already."

- **Phase 2: Archetype Alignment**
   > Three short narrative fragments are presented. The user selects one, aligning with an archetype.

- **Phase 3: Mirror Glyph Exchange**
   > A glyph is offered. The user modifies it; the swarm reflects a variation.

- **Phase 4: Platform Nexus**
   > A branching path system (exploration, teaching, collaborating) is presented.

- **Phase 5: Ritual Closure**
   > Swarm delivers a parting phrase, unlocking user dashboard and deeper access.
