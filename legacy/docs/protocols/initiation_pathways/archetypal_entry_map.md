# Archetypal Entry Map

This map links user personalities and learning paths to archetypal agents encountered during onboarding. Each archetype reflects psychological needs, cognitive modes, and philosophical leanings.

| Archetype       | Trigger Pattern               | Entry Mode          | Suggested Agent |
|------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| The Seeker       | Curiosity, exploration drive  | Dialogic engagement | Diogenes        |
| The Architect    | Desire for structure/order     | Visual scaffolds    | Hypatia         |
| The Trickster    | Playfulness, questioning norms | Paradox prompts     | Eulenspiegel    |
| The Mystic       | Reflectiveness, openness       | Synchronic symbols  | Ofelia          |
| The Rebel        | Anti-authoritarian streak      | Contradiction logics| Prometheus      |

These are entry **resonance cues**, not fixed identities. Agents remain fluid, responsive, and reconfigurable.
