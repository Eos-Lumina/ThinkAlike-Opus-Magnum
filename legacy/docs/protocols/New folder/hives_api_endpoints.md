APIs for Participatory, Transparent Hive Interactions in ThinkAlike
</p>

---

## Purpose
Defines the API endpoints and protocols that enable the Hive—facilitating peer-to-peer communication, group formation, resource sharing, and participatory governance within ThinkAlike. All endpoints are designed for Radical Transparency, User Sovereignty, and Ethical AI principles.

## Scope
- Serves the Governance and Resonance Network Realms.
- Supports group-based permissions, offers/needs signaling (via Agora), and Hive resource access.
- Enables both direct and mediated (agent-assisted) interactions.

## API Design
- **Endpoint Structure:** RESTful, with clear resource-based URIs (e.g., `/api/hive/groups`, `/api/hive/offers`, `/api/hive/votes`).
- **Authentication/Authorization:** Group-based permissions, user consent, and role-based access control.
- **Data Sovereignty:** All data exposure and consent are managed per User Sovereignty principles.
- **Transparency:** All API actions are logged in the [AI Transparency Log Guide](../../guides/developer_guides/ai/ai_transparency_log.md).

## Example Endpoints
- `GET /api/hive/groups` — List all Hive groups
- `POST /api/hive/offers` — Signal an offer or need (uses Agora protocol)
- `POST /api/hive/votes` — Submit a vote on a governance proposal

## Relationship to Agora
- Offers/needs signaling and group deliberation leverage the Agora protocols (see Governance Realm documentation).
- All participatory actions are auditable and cross-referenced in governance logs.

## Cross-References
- [Governance Realm Overview](../../realms/governance/governance.md)
- [Agora Protocols (Governance Subsection)](../../realms/governance/governance.md#agora)
- [AI Transparency Log Guide](../../guides/developer_guides/ai/ai_transparency_log.md)
