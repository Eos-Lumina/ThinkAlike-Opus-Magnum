# Protocols Directory

This directory contains all canonical ThinkAlike project protocols, organized by domain. Each protocol exists in only one location, as defined in `STRUCTURE_MANIFEST.md` and `manifest.yaml`.

- `core/`: Core operational and technical protocols (e.g., API design, initiation glyphs)
- `meta/`: Meta-level, project-wide, or process protocols (e.g., alchemical development)
- Other subfolders: Domain-specific protocols (ethics, governance, data, etc.)

**Policy:** No protocol may be duplicated. All contributors must reference this directory and the manifest for canonical locations.
