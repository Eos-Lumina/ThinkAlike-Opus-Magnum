# ThinkAlike Protocols Overview

This document provides a harmonized, modular outline for all major ThinkAlike protocols. It serves as a living map to the canonical specifications that govern the ecosystem's functionality, ensuring every protocol is fully specified, cross-linked, and up-to-date.

---

## 1. Core Protocols

- **[Interaction Protocol](./core/interaction_protocol.md)**: Defines rules for user-agent and user-user interactions, emphasizing ethical transparency and symbolic resonance.
- **[Trust Protocol](./core/trust_protocol.md)**: Governs the establishment and maintenance of trust between agents, users, and the system, incorporating resonant and restorative trust mechanisms.
- **[Model Context Protocol](./core/model_context_protocol.md)**: Standardizes how context is managed, propagated, and secured across all agent interactions and system processes.

## 2. Agent & Identity Protocols

- **[Agent Persona Protocol](./identity/agent_persona_protocol.md)**: Specifies the structure for defining agent personas, behaviors, and narrative roles.
- **[Agent Registry Protocol](./identity/agent_registry_protocol.md)**: Manages the unique identification, registration, and discovery of all agents within the system.
- **[Sybil Resistance Protocol](./identity/sybil_resistance_protocol.md)**: Outlines strategies for preventing identity-based attacks and ensuring authentic participation.

## 3. Chrona Economic Protocols

- **[Chrona Wallet Protocol](./chrona/chrona_wallet_protocol.md)**: Defines the architecture and rules for managing Chrona, the internal currency, including wallets, transactions, and demurrage.
- **[Chrona Valuation Protocol](./chrona/chrona_valuation_protocol.md)**: Outlines the mechanisms for valuing contributions, goods, and services within the Chrona economy.

## 4. Governance Protocols

- **[Contributor Recognition Protocol](./governance/contributor_recognition_protocol.md)**: Formerly the "Enlightenment Certification Protocol," this specifies how contributions are recognized, certified, and rewarded.
- **[Hive Governance Protocol](./governance/hive_governance_protocol.md)**: Defines the rules for governance within Hives, including proposals, voting, and role management.
- **[Decentralized Oversight Protocol](./governance/decentralized_oversight_protocol.md)**: Outlines the structure and function of the oversight council and audit mechanisms.

## 5. Data & Memory Protocols

- **[Akashic Record Specification](../../architecture/data_systems/akashic_record_specification.md)**: Defines the structure and API for the Akashic Record, the system's immutable log of all significant events and interactions.
- **[Agent Memory Protocol](../core/agent_memory_protocol.md)**: Specifies the interface for agent memory, including persistence, retrieval, and summarization.

## 6. Integration Protocols

- **[Participatory Economics Protocol](./integration/participatory_economics_protocol.md)**: Details the integration of Parecon principles into the ThinkAlike economy and governance.

## 7. Narrative & Onboarding Protocols

- **[Narrative Duet Protocol](../narrative/narrative_duet_protocol.md)**: Defines the structure for interactive, co-creative narrative sessions between users and agents.
- **[Onboarding Flow Protocol](./onboarding/onboarding_flow_protocol.md)**: Specifies the technical and narrative sequence for introducing new users to the ThinkAlike ecosystem.

## UI/UX & Component Specifications

- **[Profile Display](../../components/ui/profile_display.md)**: Defines the standard for displaying user and agent profiles.
- **[Ethical UI/UX Principles](../../guides/ethical_ui_ux_principles.md)**: Provides guidelines for designing user interfaces that are ethical, transparent, and empowering.
- **[AI Transparency Dashboard](../../architecture/ai_transparency_dashboard.md)**: Specifies the design and data requirements for the dashboard that provides insight into AI operations.
