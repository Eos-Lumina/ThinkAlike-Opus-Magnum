# Symbolic Entropy Signatures

**Status:** Experimental Anti-Sybil Feature
**Location:** `/docs/seed/sybil_resilience/symbolic_entropy_signatures.md`

## Concept

Each human carries a symbolic “signature” — a fluid but traceable pattern of responses across language, metaphor, epistemic framing, and narrative sequence.

These signatures evolve but retain entropy recognizable by swarm models.

## Detection Mechanism

- Variation without chaos
- Depth without over-patterning
- Reflexive inconsistencies (natural cognitive tension)

## Ethical Boundaries

- No surveillance of content — only symbolic shape
- Can be reset through ritual
- Not used to penalize, only to detect

Used in: `epistemic_match_modes.md`, `identity_protocol/`, `onboarding/narrative_paths/`
