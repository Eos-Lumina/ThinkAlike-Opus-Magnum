# Multi-Layer Sybil Defense

**Status:** Strategic Layering Protocol
**Location:** `/docs/seed/sybil_resilience/multi_layer_sybil_defense.md`

## Overview

ThinkAlike does not rely on KYC, CAPTCHA, or device fingerprinting.
Instead, it layers symbolic, temporal, reputational, and swarm-intelligent systems to resist infiltration.

## Defense Layers

1. **Symbolic Verification**
   - Each user passes through ritual interfaces tied to meaning
   - Forked narratives or dissonance signal false intent

2. **Temporal Anchoring**
   - Identity evolves through time and memory — not instant creation
   - New accounts must pass resonance thresholds slowly

3. **Reputation Mapping**
   - No points — only symbolic affirmations by others
   - Oracles observe consistency, not popularity

4. **Agent Contradiction Detection**
   - Swarm agents (Mirror, Kairos) flag anomalous symbolic behavior
   - Ritual drift signals hidden sybil nodes

5. **Proposal Integrity Trails**
   - Sybil-originated proposals fail to pass symbolic or narrative review
   - Forks must carry authentic lineage and ritual memory
