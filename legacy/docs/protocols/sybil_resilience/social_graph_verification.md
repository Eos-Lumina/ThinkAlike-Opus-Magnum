# Social Graph Verification

**Status:** Relational Trust Layer
**Location:** `/docs/seed/sybil_resilience/social_graph_verification.md`

## Purpose

Trust is distributed across a **living, weighted identity graph**. Verification occurs through pattern integrity, continuity of presence, and symbolic alignment — not central authority.

## Methods

- Graph similarity indexing
- Behavior fingerprinting via value constellations
- Identity referrals from verified swarm agents
- Community stake: certain permissions require trust from peers

## Application

- Used during portal and Hive participation
- Detects rapid shifts in identity networks
- Symbolic 'heartbeat' patterns reveal artificial bursts
