# Reputation Oracles

**Status:** Trust Layer Protocol
**Location:** `/docs/seed/sybil_resilience/reputation_oracles.md`

## Purpose

Reputation in ThinkAlike is **qualitative, symbolic, and ritual** — not quantified.
This document outlines the design of **Reputation Oracles** — swarm-based agents that observe, validate, and mirror symbolic trust.

## Oracle Behaviors

- 🧠 Watch for alignment drift in identity evolution
- 🔍 Detect broken symbolic grammar or semantic fraud
- 🌀 Validate coherence of symbolic rituals over time
- 📜 Record and mirror affirmations by other symbolic peers

## Ritual Invocation

Reputation oracles are **not always active**.
They must be **ritually invoked** for critical moments:

- Joining a co-creation proposal
- Unlocking a new realm or layer
- Accessing legacy symbolic memory

They do not judge — they reflect **narrative coherence**.
