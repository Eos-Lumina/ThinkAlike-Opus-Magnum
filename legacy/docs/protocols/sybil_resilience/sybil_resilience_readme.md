# Sybil Resilience — Overview

**Status:** Entry Document
**Location:** `/docs/seed/sybil_resilience/sybil_resilience_readme.md`

## Purpose

This folder defines ThinkAlike's symbolic, architectural, and ritual strategies for resisting sybil attacks — where fake identities, botnets, or spoofed agents attempt to infiltrate the system.

Unlike traditional platforms, ThinkAlike **refuses surveillance** as a defense mechanism.
Instead, it uses **symbolic verification**, **temporal anchoring**, **reputation resonance**, and **ritual thresholds** to remain resilient.

## Key Dimensions

- Identity coherence across time and symbol
- Ritual access gates and resonance verification
- Agent auditing and contradiction detection
- Reputation oracles and swarm observation layers
- Forkable memory trails to detect recursive sybil cloning
