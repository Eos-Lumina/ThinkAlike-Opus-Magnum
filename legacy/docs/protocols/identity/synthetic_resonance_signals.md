# Synthetic Resonance Signals

This protocol describes the generation and use of synthetic resonance signals for identity modeling and symbolic alignment in the ThinkAlike system.

---

## Purpose
- To enable advanced symbolic matching and persona synthesis.
- To support multi-agent resonance and dynamic identity flows.

---

## Implementation Notes
- Integrate with temporal identity flows and trait mapping.
- Use in conjunction with reputation layers and symbolic trait maps.

---

## Status
- Migrated from _legacy/protocols/protocols/identity/synthetic_resonance_signals.md
