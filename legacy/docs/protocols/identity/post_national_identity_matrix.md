## üåê What Is the Post-National Identity Matrix?

The **Post-National Identity Matrix (PNIM)** outlines a framework for identity in a world that transcends nation-states. It reimagines citizenship, recognition, and participation within a planetary digital commons governed by principles of cognitive liberty, shared sovereignty, and interoperable agency.

ThinkAlike serves as both infrastructure and incubator for this shift, offering users self-sovereign, forkable, and value-anchored identities.

## üß¨ Core Identity Pillars

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Forkable Identities** | Identities are fluid, multi-rooted, and user-owned ‚Äî users can fork, branch, merge, or archive their identity graphs |
| **Civic Multiplicity** | Users can belong to multiple communities, collectives, or projects with different governance, rights, and responsibilities |
| **Verifiable Claims** | All assertions (skills, contributions, affiliations) are stored as VCs linked to the DID identity stack |
| **Value Profiles** | Each identity expresses a coherent alignment of values via resonance profiles (used in narrative matching, governance, etc.) |
| **Privacy by Default** | Identities can be pseudonymous, with selectively revealed attributes |

## üèõÔ∏è From Nation to Network

| Legacy Citizenship | Post-National Identity |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| Birthright and Borders | Consent-based entry to purpose-driven collectives |
| State-Issued ID | Self-issued DIDs, community-verifiable credentials |
| Exclusive Allegiance | Fluid, multi-civic affiliations |
| State-Backed Rights | Rights encoded in community constitutions |
| Military Obligation | Ethical participation in cooperative defense (non-violent, regenerative) |

## üîÑ Identity Operations

- **Creation:** DID instantiated via ThinkAlike, linked to default or imported value profiles
- **Joining Collectives:** User submits credentials and accepts local governance terms
- **Reputation Accumulation:** Contributions tracked via VC attestations, transparent logs
- **Forking:** User migrates to a new DID (with optional carryover of credentials/reputation)
- **Resonance Matching:** Matching across projects based on shared ethical, political, or creative values
