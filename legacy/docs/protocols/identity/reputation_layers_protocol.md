## Reputation Layers Protocol: Multi-Dimensional Trust in Decentralized Social Systems

In a post-centralized digital ecosystem like ThinkAlike, reputation must evolve beyond simplistic scoring systems or opaque influence algorithms. It must become a **multi-dimensional, contextual, and user-sovereign construct**, reflecting a spectrum of verified contributions, ethical behaviors, and community-specific values. The Reputation Layers Protocol defines the architecture through which reputation is composed, stored, verified, and interpreted within the ThinkAlike identity framework.

## I. Design Goals

- **Context-Awareness:** Reputation must be specific to activity domains (governance, collaboration, dispute resolution, etc.).
- **Verifiability:** All reputation data should be cryptographically attestable and transparently auditable.
- **Portability:** Reputation is not locked to a single server or interface. Users carry it across communities.
- **User Sovereignty:** Users retain full control of their reputation keys and verifiable credentials.
- **Plural Valuation:** Communities define their own weighting and recognition schemas.

## II. Layered Reputation Model

### 1. **Layer 0 – Genesis Credentials**

- Base verifications (e.g., identity existence, DID anchoring).
- Issued at account creation or by external attestors.
- Non-weighted but required to enter certain modules.

### 2. **Layer 1 – Participation Footprint**

- Frequency, consistency, and longevity of presence across modules.
- Includes contribution to discussions, participatory voting, event attendance.
- Weighted by module entropy and participation depth.

### 3. **Layer 2 – Contribution Quality Signals**

- Peer-reviewed deliverables (code, design, writing, mediation).
- Cross-verified by community raters and AI scoring assistants.
- Reputation modularity ensures fair recognition across skill types.

### 4. **Layer 3 – Ethical Conduct History**

- Mediation logs, endorsement withdrawals, verified conflict resolutions.
- Reflections of behavioral integrity and civic alignment.
- Accessible but privacy-preserving (uses blinded hashes where necessary).

### 5. **Layer 4 – Community-Specific Accolades**

- Badges, honors, and symbolic recognitions unique to each community or realm.
- May be ephemeral or permanent, public or private.

## III. Implementation Considerations

- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs):** All layers are implemented as modular VCs, cryptographically signed and portable.
- **User Control:** Users can selectively disclose or withhold layers based on context and consent.
- **AI & Human Review:** Both algorithmic and peer review are used for quality and fairness.
- **Privacy:** Sensitive data is hashed, blinded, or zero-knowledge proven where possible.

---

## IV. Ethical Safeguards

- **No Single Reputation Score:** All layers are visible and interpretable, but never collapsed into a single number.
- **Right to Appeal:** Users can challenge or annotate negative reputation events.
- **Transparency:** All reputation logic and algorithms are open source and auditable.

## Conclusion

The Reputation Layers Protocol enables a rich, fair, and user-sovereign reputation system for ThinkAlike, supporting trust, collaboration, and ethical participation across all realms and communities.
