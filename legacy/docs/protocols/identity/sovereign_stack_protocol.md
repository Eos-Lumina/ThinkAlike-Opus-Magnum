  Canonicalized from a v1.0 blueprint to the v3.0.0 standard. This protocol defines the core, multi-layered architecture for user and agent sovereignty, integrating Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and forkable governance. All cross-references have been updated to point to canonical v3.0.0+ documents.

# Sovereign Stack Protocol: A Layered Architecture for Digital Autonomy

> *"Sovereignty in the digital realm is not achieved through withdrawal or opacity, but through radical transparency, modular autonomy, and auditable alignment."*

## 1. Purpose & Philosophical Foundation

The Sovereign Stack Protocol defines a layered, interoperable architecture enabling individual and collective sovereignty within ThinkAlike and other ethical digital ecosystems. It specifies how users, communities, and AI agents can assert autonomy, control their data, and co-create governance structures. It is designed to be portable, forkable, and platform-agnostic.

## 2. Core Principles

- **✅ Non-Coercion:** Participation is always opt-in. Data sovereignty is sacrosanct.
- **✅ Composability:** The layers of the stack can evolve independently or be combined as needed.
- **✅ Portability:** Users can export their full sovereign stack to any compatible system, ensuring freedom from platform lock-in.
- **✅ Auditability:** Every significant interaction, decision, or claim is cryptographically traceable and verifiable, governed by the `data_traceability_protocol`.
- **✅ Forkability:** Individuals or collectives can fork the governance and operational rules of their stack to create new, autonomous instances, as defined in the `architecture_fork_protocol`.

## 3. The Layered Architecture

### 3.1. Layer 1: The Identity Layer (The Bedrock of Self)

- **Anchors:** Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) provide the root of identity.
- **Credentials:** Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are used to make attestations about identity, reputation, skills, and roles, managed via the `resonant_trust_protocol`.
- **Features:** Supports pseudonymity, multi-signature identities (for collective agency), and forkable identity graphs.

### 3.2. Layer 2: The Agency Layer (The Power to Act)

- **Scope:** Defines rights, roles, permissions, and capabilities for both humans and AI agents.
- **Delegation:** Embeds AI agent delegation models, allowing agents to act on a user's behalf with explicit, revocable permissions, governed by the `agent_handoff_protocol`.
- **Granularity:** Enables fine-grained agency distribution across individuals, agents, and collectives.

### 3.3. Layer 3: The Interaction Layer (The Conduits of Connection)

- **Communication:** End-to-end encrypted, peer-to-peer communication channels.
- **Reputation:** Secure reputation signaling and endorsements that build upon the `resonant_trust_protocol`.
- **History:** Provides context-aware, auditable interaction logs.

### 3.4. Layer 4: The Governance Layer (The Rules of We)

- **Models:** Supports plug-and-play governance modules (e.g., liquid democracy, consensus protocols, local rulesets) as outlined in the `governance_protocol`.
- **Constitutions:** Enables forkable constitutions and self-determined oversight structures.

### 3.5. Layer 5: The Commons Layer (The Shared World)

- **Scope:** Governs knowledge, media, and datasets as shared public goods.
- **Licensing:** Defines transparent and programmable licensing, access, and remix rights.
- **Integration:** Connects with ThinkAlike's broader knowledge and resource commons.

## 4. Example Use Case

A user, "Aria," establishes a DID within ThinkAlike. She joins a research collective focused on sustainable agriculture. Her contributions (datasets, analysis) are issued as VCs, building her reputation within that domain. Her personal AI agent, "Kai," is delegated the agency to monitor new research papers and propose collaborations on her behalf. The collective operates under a forkable governance model where voting power is weighted by recent, relevant contributions. Aria can, at any time, export her entire stack—identity, credentials, and agent relationships—to another compatible platform.
