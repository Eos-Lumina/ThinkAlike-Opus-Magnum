# Onboarding Flow Protocol

## 1. Overview

This protocol defines the canonical onboarding journey for new users in the ThinkAlike ecosystem. It ensures a consistent, ethical, and engaging introduction, guiding users through value elicitation, persona formation, and their first Narrative Duet experience.

## 2. Onboarding Journey Stages

1. **Portal Realm Entry:**
   - User is greeted and guided by Eos Lumina∴ (the onboarding agent).
   - Introduction to system vision, values, and safety policies.
   - Completion of Initiation Glyph and Invocation Phrase.
   - Creation of UserValueProfile and digital identity.
2. **Value Elicitation:**
   - User answers symbolic and narrative prompts to surface core values.
   - Data is stored in the PCI (Personal Core Identity) profile.
   - All actions are logged for transparency and auditability.
3. **Persona Assignment:**
   - System suggests initial agent persona(s) based on value profile.
   - User can select, customize, or request guidance on persona selection.
   - Persona assignment is logged and cross-referenced with the Agent Persona Protocol.
4. **Narrative Duet (Portal):**
   - User participates in a Narrative Duet session (see Narrative Duet Protocol).
   - Choices and outcomes influence initial resonance and network placement.
   - All interactions are privacy-preserving and consent-based.
5. **Resonance Network Realm:**
   - User explores the constellation map and discovers other users/agents.
   - Ongoing support and guidance are available from Eos Lumina∴ and the community.

## 3. Data Traceability & Audit

- All onboarding actions, value submissions, and persona assignments are logged for transparency and compliance.
- Users can view their onboarding audit trail and data usage at any time.

## 4. Integration Points

- **Narrative Duet Protocol:** Governs the interactive narrative session.
- **Agent Persona Protocol:** Manages persona assignment and customization.
- **Portal & Resonance Network Realms:** Provide the user-facing context and entry points.
- **Ethics & Consent Protocols:** Ensure all onboarding steps are ethical, transparent, and consent-based.

## 5. Evolution

This protocol is a living document and will evolve as onboarding flows, user needs, and system capabilities develop. All changes are logged in the migration log for provenance.
