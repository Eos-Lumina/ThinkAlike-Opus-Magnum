# Community Hive Protocol

## 1. Purpose & Relationship to Hives Realm
Defines the structure, roles, and rituals for forming, operating, and evolving Community Hives within ThinkAlike. This protocol is the operational and governance layer for the Hives Realm (see: [Hives Realm Specification](../../docs/realms/hives/hives_specification.md)), ensuring all hives operate with clarity, equity, and symbolic resonance, supporting PET/Clarity and participatory governance.

*See also: legacy/historical versions at `../../_legacy/protocols/community_hive_protocol.md` for archival context.*

## 2. Core Principles
- **Distributed Stewardship:** Every member is a steward; leadership is fluid and role-based.
- **Ritual Onboarding:** New members are welcomed through a formal onboarding ritual, with symbolic acts and consent.
- **Consensus & Resonance:** Decisions are made through resonance-based consensus, not majority rule.
- **Transparency:** All actions, decisions, and resource flows are logged and auditable.
- **Symbolic Certification:** Rituals and certifications (e.g., badges, Chrona) are used for recognition and trust.

## 3. Hive Structure
- **Roles:** Stewards, Scribes, Ritualists, Resonance Tuners, and Members.
- **Meetings:** Regularly scheduled, with ritual opening/closing and clear agenda.
- **Resource Pool:** Collective management of shared resources (Chrona, tools, knowledge).

## 4. Rituals & Operations
- **Onboarding Ritual:** Symbolic welcome, value alignment, and consent.
- **Conflict Transmutation:** Use of ritual protocols to resolve disputes and restore harmony.
- **Contribution Recognition:** Ritual bestowal of badges and public acknowledgment.
- **Fork Voting:** Symbolic alignment, not up/downvotes (see legacy protocol for details).
- **Timebank Exchange:** Chrona as coordination substrate.
- **Swarm Agent Tasks:** Assignable via trust glyphs.

## 5. Integration & Related Realms
- Linked to Governance Realm, Hive Governance Protocol, PET/Clarity standards, and the [Hives Realm Specification](../../docs/realms/hives/hives_specification.md).
