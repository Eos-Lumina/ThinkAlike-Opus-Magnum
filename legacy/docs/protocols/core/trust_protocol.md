harmonization_note: |
  This protocol is the canonical and consolidated specification for all trust, reputation, and dispute resolution mechanisms in ThinkAlike. It merges the comprehensive framework of the "Resonant Trust Protocol" with the focused mechanisms of the "Restorative Trust Protocol" into a single, harmonized v3.0.0 standard.
  Explicitly cross-linked to OpenAPI spec and canonical data models. All integration points tracked in project TODOs/system blueprint.

# Trust Protocol: Weaving Networks of Verified Connection & Shared Reputation

## 1. Purpose & Philosophical Foundation (Trust as Living Resonance)
// ... existing code ...
- **Restorative Potential:** The system aims to support clear, equitable paths for rebuilding trust after misalignments, emphasizing learning, accountability, and restoration over punishment.

This protocol provides the foundation for safer, more meaningful, and more resonant interactions across all ThinkAlike realms where exchange, collaboration, or shared space are involved.

## 2. Core Principles
// ... existing code ...
- **Emphasis on Positive Affirmation & Constructive Feedback:** While addressing negative experiences is necessary, the system prioritizes building trust through positive reinforcement and learning from symbolic feedback.
- **Restorative Justice:** Dispute resolution focuses on understanding impact, repairing harm, and reintegrating members into the community, rather than on punitive measures.
- **Resistance to Gaming & Sybil Attacks:** Strong initial identity attestation (Portal initiation) and the multifaceted nature of trust indicators aim to make the system difficult to manipulate.

## 3. Components of an Initiate's "Trust Tapestry" (The Woven Strands)
// ... existing code ...
- A consistent history of fair, transparent, and completed Chrona exchanges (especially in the Marketplace or for services) builds transactional trust. This is secondary to value-based trust but important for economic interactions.

### Conflict Resolution & Restorative Actions (The Mended Weave)
How an Initiate navigates disputes, and their willingness to engage in restorative processes, significantly impacts their Trust Tapestry. This section outlines the protocol for handling disagreements, breaches of trust, and other conflicts. Successful restoration can even strengthen trust over time.

#### 9.1. Guiding Principles for Restoration
- **Focus on Harm, Not Rules:** The primary question is "who was harmed and what do they need?" rather than "what rule was broken?".
- **Voluntary Participation:** All parties must consent to the restorative process, though refusal to participate may have its own consequences (e.g., temporary suspension of privileges in a specific realm).
- **Community-Held:** Whenever possible and appropriate, the process is facilitated by trained community mediators or Hive representatives, not a centralized authority.
- **Transparency & Auditability:** The steps of the process are documented and auditable (with privacy considerations), ensuring fairness and accountability.

#### 9.2. The Restorative Process Flow
The process is designed to be flexible but generally follows these steps:

1.  **Initiation & Triage:**
    *   A party reports a dispute or harm through a secure, designated UI component.
    *   The report is triaged to determine its severity, scope (e.g., interpersonal, Hive-level, economic), and the relevant realms it touches.
    *   An initial check is performed to see if a simple misunderstanding can be cleared up directly with consent from both parties.

2.  **Mediation & Restorative Circles:**
    *   If the issue is more complex, a trained community mediator is assigned (or chosen by the parties involved from a pool).
    *   A "Restorative Circle" is convened, including the involved parties and, if appropriate, affected community members or Hive representatives.
    *   The facilitator guides a structured dialogue focused on:
        *   Each person's perspective of what happened.
        *   The impact and harm caused.
        *   What is needed to repair the harm.
        *   How to prevent recurrence.

3.  **Resolution & Agreement:**
    *   The outcome is a mutually agreed-upon "Restorative Agreement." This could include actions like an apology, restitution of Chrona, undertaking a specific "Quest" for learning, or a temporary change in interaction permissions.
    *   This agreement is recorded on a private, encrypted ledger associated with the participants' profiles.

4.  **Follow-up & Integration:**
    *   The system and community representatives follow up to ensure the agreement is honored.
    *   Successful completion of the agreement is a powerful positive indicator on the participants' Trust Tapestries, visible as a "Mended Weave" badge or similar symbolic representation. It demonstrates accountability and commitment to the community's health.

#### 9.3. Integration with Other Protocols
-   **Governance:** Egregious or repeated failures to engage in good faith may trigger formal governance proposals or sanctions.
-   **Chrona Economic Protocol:** Financial disputes are handled through this flow, with potential for transaction holds or reversals as part of the Restorative Agreement.
-   **UI/UX:** The entire process is supported by a clear, compassionate, and secure user interface, including reporting tools and transparency dashboards (showing aggregate, anonymized data on dispute resolution in the ecosystem).

## 10. Trust Networks (The Interwoven Fabric of Community)
The Trust Protocol extends beyond individual reputation to map and leverage emergent Trust Networks:

### 10.1. Definition:
A Trust Network is a dynamic graph where nodes are Initiates or Hives, and edges represent verified or inferred trust relationships. Edge weights can signify the strength or context of the trust.

### 10.2. Forming Trust Edges:
- **Direct Affirmation:** Successful interactions (Duets, economic exchanges, co-housing) with positive symbolic feedback create strong, direct trust edges.
- **Community Vouching:** Explicit vouches form directed trust edges.
- **Shared Hive Cohesion:** Strong, active membership in a Hive with a high HarmonicAlignmentIndex creates implicit trust links between its members when viewed by an external party considering interaction with one of them.
- **Transitive Trust (Calculated with Caution):** If A trusts B, and B trusts C, a potential (weaker, context-dependent) trust pathway between A and C may be inferred by the system (e.g., for initial recommendations). This is limited in degree and always presented as an inference.

### 10.3. Visualization & Utilization:
- **Contextual Trust Display:** When viewing another Initiate's profile, the UI will highlight shared Trust Network connections (e.g., "Vouched for by 2 people in your Hive," "You share 5 trusted connections").
- **Recommendation & Filtering:** The system can use the Trust Network to recommend potential collaborators, service providers, or Hive members who are likely to be trustworthy from the user's perspective.
- **Risk Assessment:** For high-stakes interactions (e.g., large economic exchanges, co-housing agreements), the density and strength of Trust Network connections can be a factor in assessing potential risk and suggesting safeguards.

## 11. Open Questions / Future Evolution
- Finalize the specific symbolic feedback glyphs/phrases for each interaction type.
- Develop the training "Quest" for community mediators.
- Refine the weighting algorithms for transitive trust and Trust Network strength.
- Explore integration with zero-knowledge proofs for private attestations.
