# Initiation Glyph Protocol

## 1. Purpose
The Initiation Glyph Protocol defines the standards and procedures for generating, validating, and interpreting glyphs used in the ThinkAlike ecosystem for initiation, authentication, and symbolic communication.

## 2. Glyph Structure
- Each glyph must be unique, cryptographically generated, and visually distinct.
- Glyphs encode initiation events, user roles, and system permissions.
- Metadata includes: creator, timestamp, context, and cryptographic signature.

## 3. Generation Process
1. User or agent requests initiation.
2. System generates a glyph using a secure algorithm.
3. Glyph is linked to the user's identity and initiation context.
4. All events are logged for auditability.

## 4. Validation & Revocation
- Glyphs are validated against the canonical registry.
- Revocation is possible by authorized agents or the user.

## 5. Ethical Considerations
- No glyph may be generated or used without explicit, informed consent.
- Glyph misuse is grounds for immediate review and possible system intervention.
