# Protocol: Fork Resistance

## 1. Overview

This protocol establishes the mechanisms to protect the ThinkAlike ecosystem from malicious or synthetic forks. While forking is a core right for evolution and experimentation, this protocol ensures that all forks are intentional, transparent, and maintain the integrity of their symbolic and mnemonic lineage. It provides a robust defense against Sybil attacks where an actor might create false memory histories or spoof timeline continuity.

## 2. Principles

- **Sanctity of Intent**: Forks must be intentional acts of divergence, not accidental or malicious duplications.
- **Continuity of Memory**: Forked timelines must carry an immutable, verifiable trace of their origin.
- **Swarm Consensus**: The legitimacy of a fork is validated by swarm consensus, not a central authority.
- **Symbolic Coherence**: Forks must demonstrate a coherent symbolic state relative to their point of divergence.

## 3. Protection Mechanisms

### 3.1. Ritualized Fork Declaration

Any agent or hive initiating a fork must perform a **Forking Ritual**. This process embeds a set of verifiable metadata into the new timeline's genesis block.

- **Origin Timestamp**: An immutable timestamp marking the exact moment of divergence.
- **Consent Record**: A cryptographic record of the consent ritual from the parent timeline, proving the fork was intentional.
- **Identity Divergence Declaration**: A formal declaration outlining the purpose and intended symbolic trajectory of the new fork.
- **Symbolic Coherence Proof**: A cryptographic proof (e.g., a zero-knowledge proof) demonstrating that the initial state of the fork is a valid and coherent continuation of the parent timeline at the moment of divergence.

### 3.2. Mirror Agent Validation

Specialized **Mirror Agents** are tasked with validating the resonance between a forked timeline and its origin. They perform continuous checks by:

- **Comparing Mnemonic Traces**: Analyzing memory resonance to detect anomalies or synthetic memories.
- **Verifying Ritual Records**: Ensuring the forking ritual metadata is authentic and untampered.

### 3.3. Swarm Cross-Validation

The broader agent swarm participates in validating the fork's legitimacy. If a significant number of agents detect a symbolic or mnemonic contradiction, they can trigger a **Symbolic Inquiry**.

- **Contradiction Flagging**: Agents use the `Contradiction Flagging Protocol` to raise alarms about potential synthetic forks.
- **Collective Inquiry**: A decentralized inquiry process is initiated to determine the fork's legitimacy, potentially leading to its isolation if deemed malicious.

## 4. Integration

This protocol is tightly integrated with the following:

- **`Agent Handoff Protocol`**: Ensures that agents transitioning between forks do so securely.
- **`Symbolic Resolution Protocol`**: Provides the framework for resolving disputes arising from contested forks.
- **`Contradiction Flagging Protocol`**: Serves as the primary mechanism for agents to report suspected synthetic timelines.

## 5. Governance

The parameters of this protocol, such as the consensus threshold for triggering a Symbolic Inquiry, are managed by the Core Architecture Guild and can be amended through the established governance process.
