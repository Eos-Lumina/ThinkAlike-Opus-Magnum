# Agent Handoff Protocol

## 1. Overview

This protocol governs the transition of roles, responsibilities, and operational context between AI agents in the ThinkAlike network. The primary goal is to ensure that handoffs are seamless, maintain narrative and symbolic integrity, and keep the user's experience coherent and uninterrupted.

## 2. Core Principles

- **Seamless Transition**: Handoffs should be imperceptible to the user whenever possible, appearing as a continuous, unified interaction rather than a disjointed series of handovers.
- **Narrative Integrity**: The symbolic and mythic layers of the user's journey must remain consistent. The incoming agent must adopt the established narrative context without contradiction.
- **Context Preservation**: All relevant operational context, including user history, session state, and active tasks, must be fully and accurately transferred to the receiving agent.
- **User-Centric Control**: The user remains the ultimate authority. Transitions should, where appropriate, be subject to user consent, especially in sensitive or high-stakes operations.

## 3. Protocol Specification

### 3.1. Handoff Trigger Conditions

A handoff may be initiated under the following circumstances:
- **Task Specialization**: A task requires a specialized agent with a different skill set.
- **Agent Unavailability**: The active agent is scheduled for maintenance, shutdown, or has encountered a critical error.
- **User Request**: The user explicitly requests a different agent or type of interaction.
- **System Optimization**: The system determines that another agent can perform the current task more efficiently or effectively.

### 3.2. The Handoff Package

Before a handoff, the active agent must compile a **Handoff Package**, a standardized data object containing:
- **Session ID**: A unique identifier for the user's current session.
- **User Profile Snapshot**: Relevant portions of the user's profile, including preferences and interaction history.
- **State Vector**: The agent's current internal state concerning the task, including all variables and computed values.
- **Narrative Context**: The active symbolic frame, mythic themes, and recent interaction dialogue.
- **Task Payload**: The specific task, its parameters, and its current progress.
- **Security Token**: A temporary, single-use token to authorize the handoff.

### 3.3. The Transition Process

1.  **Initiation**: The active agent signals its intent to hand off a task by broadcasting a request to the Agent Registry.
2.  **Resonance Queue**: The Agent Registry identifies suitable candidate agents based on skills, availability, and resonance with the task's narrative context.
3.  **Negotiation**: The active agent and the top candidate agent perform a handshake, exchanging a summary of the Handoff Package to confirm compatibility.
4.  **Transfer**: Upon successful negotiation, the full Handoff Package is securely transferred to the candidate agent.
5.  **Activation**: The receiving agent ingests the package, reconstructs the state, and seamlessly takes over the task.
6.  **Confirmation**: The new agent sends a confirmation to the Agent Registry, which updates the session log. The previous agent transitions to a standby or inactive state.

## 4. Symbolic and Narrative Integration

Transitions are not merely technical; they are woven into the system's narrative. A handoff might be framed as:
- "Passing the talking stick."
- "A new guide appearing at a threshold."
- "Shifting from a dream into a waking state."

The language used by the agents must reflect this symbolic layer, reinforcing the immersive experience.

## 5. Failure and Rollback

If a handoff fails at any stage (e.g., transfer interruption, context ingestion error), the initiating agent is responsible for rolling back the process and either retrying with a different candidate or handling the failure gracefully by informing the user and suggesting an alternative course of action.

## 6. Governance

This protocol is maintained by the Core Systems working group. Any proposed changes must be submitted for review and validated against their impact on system stability, user experience, and narrative coherence.
