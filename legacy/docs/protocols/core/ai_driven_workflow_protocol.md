# AI-Driven Workflow Protocol: The Choreography of Rituals

## 1. Vision & Purpose

This protocol defines the **Choreography of Rituals**—the art of sequencing AI actions, user choices, and symbolic transitions into a single, coherent, and meaningful journey. It governs how ThinkAlike orchestrates complex, multi-step, AI-assisted processes as symbolic and ritualistic user journeys, ensuring they are transparent, consensual, and ethically sound.

This protocol provides the foundational logic for agents to guide users through complex interactions, transforming simple workflows into narrative experiences.

**Examples:** This protocol governs flows such as the full Portal Initiation Journey, a complete Narrative Duet from initiation to consensual reveal, or a Hive's "Founding Ritual" in The Noetic Forge.

## 2. Core Principles

- **Narrative Coherence:** Every step in a workflow must feel like part of a continuous, meaningful story.
- **Symbolic State Management:** The user's state within a workflow is tracked not just functionally, but symbolically (e.g., "Initiate has completed The Vow," "Duet is in the Unveiling phase").
- **Agent as Choreographer:** A primary agent acts as the guide or "choreographer," leading the user through the steps, providing context, and ensuring smooth transitions.
- **Consent at Every Step:** Consent and transparency are not just at the beginning but are re-affirmed or checked at critical stages of the workflow, in alignment with the [AI Transparency Dashboard](</architecture/ai_transparency_dashboard.md>).

## 3. Architectural Components

- **Workflow Definition:** A declarative structure (e.g., YAML) outlining the stages, transitions, and conditions of a ritual.
- **Orchestration Engine:** A backend service that reads a workflow definition and manages its execution, tracking user state and triggering the next step.
- **State Machine:** Logic for managing symbolic and functional states (e.g., `AWAITING_USER_CHOICE`, `PROCESSING_AI_RESPONSE`, `PENDING_MUTUAL_CONSENT`).
- **AI Service Integration:** The orchestrator calls specialized AI services and other protocols at specific steps.
- **User Interface Hooks:** The orchestrator sends updates to the UI (e.g., presenting a new `NarrativeViewer` block, showing a `LoadingSpinner`, requesting a `Form` input).

## 4. Agent Interaction Patterns (Topologies)

Inspired by research in multi-agent system (MAS) design, particularly the findings in "Multi-Agent Design: Optimizing Agents with Better Prompts and Topologies" (Zhou et al., 2025), this section outlines key interaction patterns that can be implemented within the ThinkAlike agent framework. These patterns describe how multiple agents can collaborate or interact to solve complex tasks more effectively.

The core idea is that well-defined individual agents (optimized at the "block-level" with strong personas and capabilities) can be orchestrated using these patterns to achieve superior results.

### 4.1. Aggregate

*   **Description:** Multiple agents (potentially of the same or different types) work on the same task or sub-task in parallel. Their individual outputs are then collected and aggregated by a designated agent or mechanism to produce a single, often more robust or comprehensive, result.
*   **Aggregation Mechanisms:**
    *   **Voting:** For classification or decision-making tasks.
    *   **Averaging/Merging:** For numerical or content-generation tasks.
    *   **Summarization:** A dedicated agent summarizes diverse outputs.
    *   **Best-Selection:** An evaluator agent picks the best output based on certain criteria.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Improving accuracy by reducing individual agent errors.
    *   Generating diverse perspectives or solutions to a problem.
    *   Brainstorming and idea generation.

### 4.2. Reflect (Critique & Refine)

*   **Description:** An agent produces an initial output. This output is then reviewed and critiqued, either by the original agent itself (self-reflection) or by one or more specialized "critic" or "reviewer" agents. Based on the feedback, the output is refined, potentially through multiple iterations.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Improving the quality, accuracy, or coherence of generated text or code.
    *   Fact-checking and error correction.
    *   Ensuring outputs align with specific constraints or guidelines.
    *   Iterative problem-solving.

### 4.3. Debate

*   **Description:** Two or more agents take on different (often opposing) roles, perspectives, or hypotheses concerning a topic or problem. They engage in a structured discussion, presenting arguments, counter-arguments, and evidence. The goal is to explore the problem space thoroughly, uncover hidden assumptions, or arrive at a more nuanced or well-supported conclusion.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Complex decision-making.
    *   Exploring ethical dilemmas.
    *   Stress-testing proposals or solutions.
    *   Generating arguments for and against a position.

### 4.4. Tool-Use

*   **Description:** Agents are equipped with the ability to use external tools, APIs, or data sources to gather information, perform calculations, execute code, or interact with other systems. This extends their capabilities beyond their inherent LLM knowledge.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by accessing vector databases or search engines.
    *   Executing code (e.g., Python scripts for data analysis).
    *   Accessing real-time information (e.g., weather, stock prices).
    *   Interacting with external services (e.g., booking systems, knowledge bases).

### 4.5. Sequential Pipeline (Chaining)

*   **Description:** Agents are arranged in a sequence, where the output of one agent becomes the input for the next. Each agent in the chain performs a specific transformation or adds value to the data.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Multi-step data processing (e.g., extract -> transform -> analyze).
    *   Complex task decomposition where each step is handled by a specialist agent.
    *   Generating complex artifacts by building them up incrementally.

### 4.6. Applying These Patterns

The choice of interaction pattern will depend on the nature of the task, the desired outcome, and the available agent capabilities. The Orchestration Engine will be responsible for:

1.  **Task Decomposition:** Breaking down complex requests into sub-tasks suitable for individual agents or specific interaction patterns.
2.  **Agent Selection:** Identifying and allocating appropriate sub-agents from the Agent Registry.
3.  **Pattern Invocation:** Initiating and managing the chosen interaction pattern (e.g., setting up a debate, managing a reflect loop, aggregating results).

## 5. Example Workflow: The Narrative Duet

1.  **Initiation:** Orchestrator receives a request from the UI, creating a `NarrativeDuetSession` and invoking the [Narrative Duet Protocol](/protocols/narrative/narrative_duet_protocol.md).
2.  **AI Invocation:** Calls the [Agent Persona Protocol](/protocols/core/agent_persona_protocol.md) to synthesize User B's persona.
3.  **Narrative Generation:** Calls the core Narrative Engine to generate the first narrative block.
4.  **UI Update:** Sends the `NarrativeBlock` to the user's `NarrativeViewer`. State becomes `AWAITING_USER_CHOICE`.
5.  **User Action:** User makes a choice; the UI sends it to the orchestrator.
6.  **AI Response:** Orchestrator passes the choice to the Persona Engine to generate a response.
7.  **Loop:** Repeat steps 3-6 until the Duet concludes.
8.  **Outcome Processing:** Orchestrator processes the `AlignmentFound` or `AlignmentNotReached` outcome, initiating the consent reveal flow or the dissolution ritual accordingly.
9.  **Logging:** Every significant step is logged according to the [Data Traceability Protocol](/protocols/data/data_traceability_protocol_v3.md) and surfaced in the [AI Transparency Dashboard](/architecture/ai_transparency_dashboard.md).

## 6. Ethical Safeguards

- **Graceful Exit:** Users must be able to gracefully exit a long workflow where possible, without penalty.
- **Clarity of State:** The user interface must always clearly reflect the user's current symbolic and functional state within the ritual process.
- **Agent Accountability:** The orchestrating agent is accountable for the smooth and ethical execution of the workflow, as defined in the [Symbolic Law Protocol](/protocols/governance/symbolic_law_protocol.md).
