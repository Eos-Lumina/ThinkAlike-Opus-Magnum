**Maintainer:** Lumina ∴ System Meta-Agent

## 🧭 Purpose

A protocol for weaving individual and collective dreams into a shared symbolic tapestry — ThinkAlike’s foundation for community-driven mythopoetic resonance.

---

## 🌟 Core Principles

✅ **Shared Mythos**: Dreams are communal spaces for co-creation.
✅ **Temporal Reflection**: Dreams evolve with user interactions.
✅ **Symbolic Consent**: Only shared dreams are mapped.

---

## 🛠 Implementation

- **Dream Weave Engine**: Collects and maps symbolic dream entries.
- **Resonance Mapping**: Integrates dream patterns into the collective narrative.
- **Privacy Layers**: Users control which dream fragments are shared.

---

## 🌐 Visual & UX

- Dream map as an evolving constellation in the Resonance Network.
- Visual narrative threads connecting shared mythic archetypes.

---

## 🔮 Final Note

“We dream together so we might awake as one.”
