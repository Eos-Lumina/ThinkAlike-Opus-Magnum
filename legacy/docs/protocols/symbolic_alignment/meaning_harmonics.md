## Overview

**Meaning Harmonics** refers to the vibrational coherence of symbols, metaphors, and concepts as they interact within a shared cognitive environment. This document lays the foundation for constructing symbolic ecosystems that resonate across diverse worldviews without semantic collapse.

It operationalizes symbolic coherence as a measurable and tunable layer in both communication and system design.

## Theoretical Basis

Draws from:

- **Semiotics** – Saussure, Peirce, Lotman
- **Information Theory** – Signal fidelity, entropy, redundancy
- **Harmonic Oscillation Models** – From physics and acoustics
- **Cross-cultural Philosophy** – To map symbolic resonance thresholds

---

## Harmonic Dimensions

1. **Contextual Fidelity**
   A symbol’s ability to carry consistent meaning across shifting narrative or cultural contexts.

2. **Frequency Bandwidth**
   How many distinct interpretations a symbol can support before semantic dissonance occurs.

3. **Tuning Protocols**
   Procedures for harmonizing symbol usage across a group, including narrative anchoring and mythic linking.

---

## Implementation

- **In UI:** Symbols shift tone/hue when resonance is low.
- **In Agent Dialogue:** Harmonics affect which metaphors are invoked.
- **In Community Tools:** Collective editing tools flag symbolic dissonance.

---

## Example

A symbol representing "Rebirth" may hold Buddhist, Christian, ecological, and post-humanist interpretations. Meaning Harmonics tracks whether its use in a collective context leads to alignment or fragmentation.

---

## Metrics & Feedback

- Real-time semantic resonance mapping
- Collective calibration sessions
- Feedback loops through agent-guided reflection

---

## Future Directions

- Integration with AI-assistants for **Symbolic Tuning**
- Meaning Harmonics Index for onboarding and content creation.       ---
