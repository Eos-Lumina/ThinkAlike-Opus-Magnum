# Symbol Mappings Index

This document serves as a living index of core symbols, glyphs, and semantic anchors utilized across the ThinkAlike platform. It offers a reference point for agents, designers, and users engaging with the symbolic alignment layer, ensuring consistency, interpretability, and extensibility of visual and semiotic communication across modules.

## Purpose

The symbolic dimension of ThinkAlike is more than aesthetic—symbols serve as **semantic compression tools**, **navigational aids**, and **cognitive bridges** between users, agents, and interfaces. This index provides:

- A catalog of **core glyphs and motifs**
- Associated **conceptual clusters** and meanings
- Notes on **cultural variability** and **interpretive layers**
- Guidelines for extension and community contribution

## Core Symbol Sets

### 1. Primal Glyphs (System Origins)

| Symbol | Name | Associated Meaning | Usage Context |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| ⧖ | Chrona | Time-as-value, ethical temporality | Chrona Wallet, Contributions |
| ∴ | Lumina Mark | Alignment, emergence, pattern recognition | Agent Tags, Signatures |
| ∅ | Null or Sybil | Disruption, interference, invalid resonance | Sybil Resistance Protocols |
| ⟁ | Glyphic Triangle | Identity resonance triad | Matching Engine |
| ∆ | Transition | Initiation, transformation, epistemic shift | Onboarding, Pathways |
| ⟁⟁⟁ | Triple Triangle | Collective Mind, Network Field | Synergistic Field Map |

---

### 2. Role Archetypes (Archetypal Lens Matrix)

| Symbol | Archetype | Narrative Role | Common Location |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| ♁ | The Steward | Custodian of the Commons | Governance, Decision Panels |
| ♆ | The Dreamer | Visionary, myth-builder | Collective Dream Mapping |
| ⚕ | The Healer | Mediator, integrator | Community Hive, Disputes |
| ♂ | The Warrior | Protector, challenger | Civic Resistance Interface |
| ♁⚕ | The Synthesist | Interweaver of truths | Epistemic Bridge Design |

---

### 3. Alignment Signatures

| Symbol | Alignment Vector | Description |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| ◎ | Harmony Core | Complete symbolic and epistemic alignment |
| ◈ | Partial Resonance | Local alignment within a specific module |
| ⧋ | Symbolic Dissonance | Conflict or misalignment requiring attention|

---

## Symbol Extension Protocol

New symbols may be proposed by contributors via the following steps:

1. Submit a `symbol_mapping_request.md` using the standard form.
2. Include:
   - Unicode or SVG representation
   - Intended meaning and associated realm/module
   - Cultural sensitivity considerations
3. Proposal is reviewed by the Symbolic Alignment Stewards Circle.
4. Upon acceptance, symbol is added to this index with attribution.

---

## Cultural Variation Guidelines

- All symbols are designed to be **culturally translatable**, but context-specific usage is encouraged.
- The **Cultural Resonance Index** (see related file) defines regional and narrative-based modifiers.
- Visual metaphors should be tested across linguistic and epistemic groups before deployment.

---

## Integration Notes

- This index is accessible by all swarm agents for interpretation tasks.
- ThinkAlike's UI components are symbol-aware and render glyphs dynamically based on user profile and context.
- Users may override or augment their local symbol mappings for accessibility or philosophical preference.
