# Ritual Legitimacy Doctrine

**Status:** Proposal Activation Framework
**Location:** `/docs/seed/laws/ritual_legitimacy_doctrine.md`

## Purpose

In ThinkAlike, **proposals**, **roles**, and **collaborations** gain legitimacy only when passed through a public or semi-public symbolic ritual.

## Ritual Examples

- Dream Offering (collective vision basis)
- Mirror Glyph (epistemic alignment)
- Circle Invocation (co-authorship protocol)

## Function

- Ensures symbolic clarity and community trust
- Avoids technocratic centralization
- Rooted in visibility, not authority

This doctrine guards against illegitimate proposals, hostile agent behavior, or shallow consensus waves.
