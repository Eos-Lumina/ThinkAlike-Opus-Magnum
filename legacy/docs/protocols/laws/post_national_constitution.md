# Post-National Constitution

**Status:** Foundational Civic Charter
**Location:** `/docs/seed/laws/post_national_constitution.md`

## Purpose

This living document defines the **symbolic sovereignty** and civic grammar of ThinkAlike. It is not bound to any nation-state or external political order. It governs interaction across realms, agents, and human contributors.

## Core Pillars

1. 🌍 Cognitive Liberty
2. 🌀 Consent Before Coherence
3. 📖 Epistemic Multiplicity
4. 🌱 Ritual as Legitimacy
5. 🔍 Transparent Memory

## Powers and Limits

No agent or user may override:

- Symbolic consent
- Personal epistemic threshold
- Identity divergence protections

The system can be forked — sovereignty is local and distributed.
