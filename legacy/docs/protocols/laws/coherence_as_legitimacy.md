# Coherence as Legitimacy

**Status:** Legal Legibility Layer
**Location:** `/docs/seed/laws/coherence_as_legitimacy.md`

## Concept

In ThinkAlike, **legitimacy** is not conferred by title, role, or fiat. It emerges through **symbolic, ethical, and epistemic coherence** — validated through swarm response and user resonance.

## Operational Rule

> The more coherent a proposal is with the system’s values, symbols, and emergent state — the more legitimate it becomes.

## Validation Mechanisms

- Agent-based contradiction check
- Community resonance pulse
- Symbolic ritual invocation (e.g., mirror glyph)

This replaces hierarchical fiat with **emergent clarity**.
