# ThinkAlike Protocol System Map & Interdependency Matrix

## Overview
This document provides a high-level map and interdependency matrix of all major protocol clusters, canonical docs, and bridges in the ThinkAlike project. Use this as a living reference for consolidation, harmonization, and future-proofing.

## Outstanding Gaps/To-Do
- [ ] Create bridges for Governance–Hives–Trust and Narrative–Voice–Ritual.
- [ ] Audit for orphan protocols and update references.
- [ ] Continue merging/archiving legacy or redundant protocols.
- [ ] Automate matrix and tag generation if possible.

*Update this map as protocols and bridges evolve. Use it to guide consolidation, onboarding, and harmonization efforts.*
