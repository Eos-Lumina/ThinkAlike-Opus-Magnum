# ThinkAlike Protocol Bridging & Harmonization To-Do Plan

## 1. Protocol Cluster Inventory
- [ ] List all protocol clusters (Agent, Narrative, Voice, Onboarding, Data, Governance, Rituals, UI/UX, etc.)
- [ ] For each cluster, inventory canonical docs and key extracted/archived files

## 2. Concept Extraction & Tagging
- [ ] Extract core concepts, principles, and user flows from each canonical doc
- [ ] Tag each doc with key concepts, flows, and dependencies (e.g., voice, ritual, symbolic_questions, privacy, onboarding, accessibility)

## 3. Cross-Reference Matrix
- [ ] Build a matrix/table mapping which concepts/flows are present in which docs
- [ ] Identify missing cross-references and weak links between clusters

## 4. Bridging Doc Checklist
- [ ] For every missing/weak link, add a bridging doc/update to a checklist
- [ ] Examples:
    - [ ] Onboarding–Voice–Symbolic Questions Bridge
    - [ ] Agent–Narrative–Voice UX Bridge
    - [ ] Governance–Ritual–Transparency Bridge

## 5. Bridging Doc Creation & Updates
- [ ] Batch-create bridging docs using a standard template:
    - Purpose of the bridge
    - Source and target protocols
    - Key concepts to harmonize
    - Canonical references
    - Implementation notes
- [ ] Update canonical docs to reference new bridges

## 6. Review & Harmonization Log
- [ ] Maintain a harmonization log for each cluster:
    - Bridging docs created
    - Outstanding gaps
    - Review status ([REVIEW], [ARCHIVE], [EXTRACT])

## 7. Automation & Ongoing Maintenance
- [ ] Use scripts/tools to auto-tag and extract concepts from new/updated docs
- [ ] Alert when new protocols are added without proper cross-references
- [ ] Periodically regenerate the cross-reference matrix and bridging checklist
