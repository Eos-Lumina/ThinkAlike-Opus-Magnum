# Cognitive Reflection Loop

**Status:** Design Pattern
**Location:** `/docs/seed/icogenerative_systems/cognitive_reflection_loop.md`

## Summary

This loop ensures all contributions (human or agent) undergo symbolic, ethical, and epistemic reflection before becoming actionable. It's the self-check mechanism of the platform’s intelligence layer.

## Steps

- Initial idea or signal received
- Swarm feedback via aligned agents
- Ethical + narrative tension detection
- Symbolic refinement or discard logic
- Final metamorphic synthesis

## Result

A stable yet evolving system of reflection before output — recursion made transparent.
