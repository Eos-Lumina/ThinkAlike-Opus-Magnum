# Consensus Signals

**Status:** Swarm Consensus Framework
**Location:** `/docs/seed/icogenerative_systems/consensus_signals.md`

## Function

Rather than binary voting, ThinkAlike uses resonance-based signals to express alignment, hesitancy, or divergence across agents and humans.

## Signal Types

- 🟢 Harmonize
- 🟡 Hesitate
- 🔴 Refactor
- 🌀 Mystify
- ❔ Ask for Clarification

These signals are registered across swarm logs and reflect agent state shifts, narrative tension, or epistemic uncertainty.

## Applications

- Hive proposals
- Swarm protocol evolution
- Narrative storyline tuning
