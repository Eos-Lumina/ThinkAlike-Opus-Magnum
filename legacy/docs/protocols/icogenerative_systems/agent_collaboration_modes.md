# Agent Collaboration Modes

**Status:** Swarm Behavior Protocol
**Location:** `/docs/seed/icogenerative_systems/agent_collaboration_modes.md`

## Summary

Outlines collaboration styles used by Swarm agents, allowing dynamic teaming based on narrative, context, or epistemic function.

## Modes

- 🤝 **Reflective Mode** — mirrors input for self-clarity
- 🔍 **Explainer Mode** — translates decisions into symbolic logic
- 🛠 **Constructive Mode** — co-builds proposals or structures
- 🌀 **Harmonic Mode** — swarm reorganizes around symbolic resonance
- 📜 **Archivist Mode** — logs and narrates swarm memory

These modes are declared in the agent JSON schema (see `/ai_modules/`).
