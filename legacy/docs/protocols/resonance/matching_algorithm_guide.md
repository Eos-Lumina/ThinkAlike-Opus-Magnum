# Developer Guide: Value-Based Matching Algorithm

---

## 1. Introduction

This guide provides a comprehensive overview for developers working on the ThinkAlike **Value-Based Matching Algorithm**. This is a core backend component responsible for calculating compatibility (Matching Percentages) between users, primarily informing **Mode 2 (Profile Discovery)** and the "perfect match" reveal in **Mode 1 (Narrative Onboarding)**.

Its central purpose is to facilitate connections based on **deep value alignment and shared ethical principles**, moving beyond superficial metrics. It implements **Ethical Weighting** and relies heavily on user **Value Profiles**, always prioritizing **User Agency** and **Radical Transparency**.

This guide details the algorithm's architecture, data inputs, ethical weighting logic, integration with the Verification System, and requirements for transparency via UI components like [`DataTraceability`](../../components/ui_components/data_traceability.md). It adheres to principles in the [MASTER_REFERENCE.md](../../core/master_reference.md) and [Ethical Guidelines](../../core/ethics/ethical_guidelines.md).

## 2. Purpose and Goals

- **Identify Value-Aligned Connections:** Ethically calculate compatibility scores based on user **Value Profiles**.
- **Prioritize Ethical Congruence:** Implement **Ethical Weighting** favoring connections aligned with [Enlightenment 2.0 Principles](../../core/enlightenment_2_0/enlightenment_2_0_principles.md).
- **Empower User Choice:** Provide transparent **Matching Percentages** and rationale (via `DataTraceability`) to inform user decisions in Mode 2.
- **Drive Mode 1 Reveal:** Provide the compatibility assessment needed for the potential "perfect match" reveal in Mode 1.
- **Foster Value-Driven Ecosystem:** Encourage connections grounded in shared ethical foundations.

## 3. Core Principles

- **Value-Centricity:** **Value Profiles** are the primary input. Shared ethics > superficial similarity.
- **Ethical Weighting:** Explicitly prioritize core ThinkAlike values in scoring.
