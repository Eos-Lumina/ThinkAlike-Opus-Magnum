# Data Lifecycle & Security Protocol

## 1. Vision & Purpose

This protocol governs the complete lifecycle of data within the ThinkAlike ecosystem, from its creation to its eventual archival or deletion. It ensures that all data is managed securely, ethically, and in compliance with legal frameworks like GDPR. It also defines the strategies for system resilience, including disaster recovery and business continuity, to protect the integrity of the collective's digital memory.

This protocol is the operational counterpart to the [Data Architecture](/architecture/data_architecture.md) and the [Data Traceability Protocol](/protocols/data/data_traceability_protocol.md), providing the rules for how data is handled in practice.

## 2. Core Principles

- **User Sovereignty:** Users have ultimate control over their data, including the rights to access, rectify, and erase it.
- **Data Minimization:** We collect and retain only the data that is essential for the system's function and the user's experience.
- **Security by Design:** Security is not an afterthought but a foundational component of our architecture and operations.
- **Resilience & Continuity:** The system is designed to withstand failures and recover gracefully, ensuring the persistence of the collective's shared reality.
- **Transparent Compliance:** Our compliance with legal and ethical standards is transparent and auditable.

## 3. GDPR & User Rights Compliance

This section outlines the mechanisms for ensuring compliance with GDPR and upholding user data rights.

- **Right to Access & Portability:** Users must be able to request and receive an export of all their personal data in a structured, machine-readable format (e.g., JSON) via their profile settings.
- **Right to Rectification:** Users must be able to correct or update their personal information directly through the UI.
- **Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten"):**
    - **Mechanism:** A user-initiated request triggers a two-stage process.
    1.  **Soft Deletion:** The user's account and associated data are immediately made inaccessible and flagged for deletion.
    2.  **Hard Deletion:** After a 30-day grace period, all personal data is permanently deleted from primary databases. For immutable logs, cryptographic erasure (deleting the keys that decrypt the user's data) will be employed, rendering the data permanently unreadable.
    - **Traceability:** The act of deletion is recorded in the `TraceabilityRecord` system with anonymized metadata, preserving the integrity of the log without retaining personal data.
- **Consent Management:**
    - All data processing activities require explicit, granular, and revocable user consent, managed via `ConsentRecord` entities as defined in the [Data Architecture](/architecture/data_architecture.md).
    - Consent must be re-affirmed for any new data processing purposes.

## 4. Data Archival & Retention

- **Archival Policy:**
    - **Active Data:** Data directly related to ongoing user activity (e.g., active Narrative Duets, recent transactions) is kept in hot storage.
    - **Inactive Data:** User accounts inactive for more than 24 months will be considered dormant. The user will be notified, and if no action is taken, the account will be archived.
    - **Archived Data:** Archived data is moved to secure, cost-effective cold storage. Access is heavily restricted and logged.
- **Retention Periods:**
    - **User Data:** Retained as long as the account is active, or until an erasure request is processed.
    - **Transactional & Traceability Logs:** Retained for a minimum of 7 years for legal and audit purposes, with personal identifiers pseudonymized where possible.

## 5. Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

- **Backup Strategy:**
    - **Frequency:** Full, encrypted backups of all production databases and critical infrastructure are performed daily. Transaction logs are backed up continuously.
    - **Storage:** Backups are stored in a geographically separate, secure location.
    - **Integrity:** Backups are regularly tested for integrity and restorability.
- **Recovery Plan:**
    - **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** Maximum acceptable data loss is 1 hour.
    - **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** Time to restore critical services is 4 hours.
    - **Procedure:** A detailed, documented recovery plan is maintained and accessible to authorized personnel.
- **Testing & Drills:** Disaster recovery drills are conducted quarterly to validate the recovery plan and ensure the readiness of the response team.
