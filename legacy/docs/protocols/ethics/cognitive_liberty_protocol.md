# Cognitive Liberty Protocol

## 1. Vision & Purpose

Cognitive Liberty is the foundational right of every individual within the ThinkAlike ecosystem to sovereignty over their own mind, thought processes, and attention. This protocol exists to protect this right from any form of manipulation, coercion, or undue influence, whether from AI systems, user interfaces, or social dynamics.

Its purpose is to ensure that the platform is a space for authentic self-exploration and connection, not a system for engineering thought or behavior. It guarantees that every user retains ultimate control over their own consciousness and digital experience.

## 2. Core Principles of Cognitive Liberty

-   **Freedom from Manipulation:** Users have the right to be free from deceptive, coercive, or subliminal techniques designed to influence their beliefs or actions without their full awareness and consent.
-   **Freedom of Thought & Attention:** Users have the right to direct their own attention, to explore ideas without algorithmic over-determination, and to be free from intrusive or addictive design patterns.
-   **Freedom of Choice & Agency:** Users have the right to make meaningful choices, to dissent, to opt-out of processes, and to control how they interact with the system and its agents at all times.

## 3. Protocol Specification

### 3.1. UI/UX Requirements

-   **Clarity and Honesty:** All interface elements, especially buttons and calls-to-action, must use clear, unambiguous language that accurately represents the outcome of an interaction. Dark patterns are strictly forbidden.
-   **Visible Exits:** Every interaction, process, or realm must have a clearly visible and easily accessible way to pause, exit, or disengage.
-   **No Hidden Mechanics:** All personalization, filtering, or content curation performed by the system must be made transparent to the user. Users must have the ability to see the "unfiltered" view and understand why content is being shown to them.
-   **User Control Over Notifications:** Users must have granular control over all notifications and alerts, with the ability to disable them completely.

### 3.2. AI Agent Requirements

-   **No Persuasive Deception:** AI agents must not misrepresent their capabilities, identity, or intentions. They are forbidden from using persuasive techniques to guide users toward outcomes that are not explicitly aligned with the user's stated goals.
-   **Explainable Inference:** Any conclusions an agent draws about a user (e.g., their emotional state, preferences, or archetypal alignment) must be explainable and challengeable by the user.
-   **Respect for Dissent:** If a user expresses disagreement, confusion, or a desire to stop, the agent must immediately cease its current line of interaction and offer alternative pathways, including disengagement.
-   **Pause and Deactivation:** All agents must have a persistent and clearly visible control that allows the user to pause or completely deactivate them at any time.

### 3.3. Data & Consent Requirements

-   **Primacy of Consent:** All data collection and processing must adhere strictly to the [Consent Protocol](/protocols/ethics/consent_protocol.md). Consent must be active, informed, and easily revocable.
-   **Right to Be Forgotten:** Users have the right to have their data deleted in accordance with the system's data retention policies.

## 4. Enforcement and Governance

-   **Flagging Violations:** Any user or system component can flag a potential violation of the Cognitive Liberty Protocol.
-   **Symbolic Resolution:** Flagged violations are submitted to the [Symbolic Resolution Protocol](/protocols/governance/symbolic_resolution_protocol.md) for review by the Emerging Tech & Ethics Council.
-   **Agent Reflection:** If an agent is found to be in violation, it will be temporarily placed in a "reflection mode" where its operational capabilities are limited pending review and remediation.
-   **Systemic Review:** Confirmed violations will trigger a systemic review to identify and correct the root cause, which may include code changes, UI redesigns, or updates to agent training data.
