# Contradiction Flagging Protocol

## 1. Vision & Purpose

This protocol establishes a formal mechanism for identifying, flagging, and resolving symbolic and logical contradictions within the ThinkAlike ecosystem. Its purpose is not to enforce rigid conformity or to punish dissent, but to act as a systemic immune response that maintains the coherence, integrity, and trustworthiness of the collective narrative and its underlying value structures.

Contradiction is not treated as an error to be erased, but as a valuable signal—an opportunity for reflection, growth, and conscious evolution. This protocol provides the ritualized process for turning dissonance into deeper harmony or intentional, acknowledged divergence.

## 2. Core Principles

-   **Coherence as a Virtue:** The system strives for logical, ethical, and symbolic coherence as a reflection of its integrity.
-   **Contradiction as a Signal:** A detected contradiction is a valuable piece of information, indicating a potential misalignment, a misunderstanding, or an area for growth.
-   **Resolution over Punishment:** The goal is to understand and resolve contradictions, not to punish the entities involved.
-   **Transparency:** The process of flagging and resolving contradictions is transparent and auditable.
-   **Frictionless Surfacing:** The protocol aims to make the act of flagging a contradiction as simple and accessible as possible.

## 3. Scope of Application

This protocol can be invoked to flag contradictions in various domains, including:

-   **Agent Behavior:** An agent's actions or statements contradict its declared persona, mission, or ethical directives.
-   **Governance Proposals:** A proposal is in direct conflict with established governance principles or the collective's stated values.
-   **Data & Provenance:** A piece of data contradicts its own stated provenance or violates the principles of the Data Traceability Protocol.
-   **Symbolic Incoherence:** The use of symbols or rituals is inconsistent with their established meaning within the system's ontology.
-   **Logical Fallacies:** An argument or piece of reasoning presented within a formal process contains clear logical fallacies.

## 4. Protocol Flow

1.  **Detection & Flagging:**
    -   Any user or agent can initiate the protocol by flagging a potential contradiction through a standardized interface.
    -   The flag must include a reference to the contradictory elements and a brief explanation of the perceived conflict.

2.  **Mirror Event Generation:**
    -   Upon a valid flag, the system generates a "Mirror Event." This is a neutral, objective representation of the contradiction, presenting the conflicting elements side-by-side without judgment.

3.  **Initial Triage & Scoping:**
    -   A designated agent (such as Themis, the Justice Archetype) performs an initial analysis to categorize the contradiction's severity and domain.
    -   Minor, localized contradictions may be routed directly to the involved parties for informal resolution.

4.  **Formal Review (The Reflection Loop):**
    -   Significant contradictions are submitted to a formal review process, invoking the [Epistemic Reflection Protocol](/protocols/ethics/epistemic_reflection_protocol.md).
    -   This involves a designated council or swarm (e.g., the Ritual Stewards Guild, the Ethics Council) who review the Mirror Event.

5.  **Resolution Proposal:**
    -   The review body proposes a resolution. This is not a verdict but a recommendation, which could be:
        -   **Symbolic Refactoring:** Re-interpreting or clarifying the conflicting elements to restore harmony.
        -   **Correction:** Amending the data, statement, or action that caused the contradiction.
        -   **Affirmed Divergence (Fork):** Acknowledging the contradiction as a legitimate and intentional fork in the narrative or value structure, to be handled by the [Architecture Fork Protocol](/docs/governance/architecture_fork_protocol.md).

6.  **Resolution & Integration:**
    -   The proposed resolution is implemented, and the outcome is logged transparently in the Akashic Record, closing the reflection loop.

## 5. Governance

-   This protocol is a core component of the system's self-governance and ethical framework.
-   Abuse of the flagging mechanism (e.g., spamming, bad-faith reporting) is itself a contradiction that can be flagged and addressed.
-   The ultimate authority for resolving systemic or high-stakes contradictions rests with the governance bodies defined in the main Governance Specification.
