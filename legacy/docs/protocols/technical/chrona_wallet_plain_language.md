# Plain-Language Guide: Chrona Wallet & Economic Protocol

This guide explains, in simple terms, how you use the Chrona Wallet and participate in the ThinkAlike economy. No technical knowledge required!

---

## 1. What is Chrona?
- Chrona is a special currency based on time and contribution, designed to reward everyone fairly.
- You receive Chrona regularly as Universal Basic Income (UBI), just for being part of the community.

## 2. Your Chrona Wallet
- Your wallet is where you see your Chrona balance and all your activity.
- You can check how much Chrona you have, see where it came from, and what you’ve used it for.
- The wallet also shows your TimeSteward rank (how much you’ve contributed) and if any of your Chrona is about to “decay” (to encourage sharing and use).

## 3. Receiving Chrona (UBI)
- Every week (or another set time), you get a new deposit of Chrona in your wallet.
- You’ll get a notification and can see this in your transaction history.

## 4. Sending and Using Chrona
- You can send Chrona to others as a gift, payment, or to participate in community rituals.
- The process is simple and includes prompts to help you reflect on the meaning of your action.
- Every transaction is secure, transparent, and recorded for your review.

## 5. Transparency & Control
- You can always see a full history of your Chrona activity.
- You can export your data or review how Chrona is being used in the community.
- All rules about UBI, decay, and transactions are clear and easy to find.

**Why this matters:**
- Chrona is designed to be fair, transparent, and meaningful.
- You are always in control of your wallet and your data.
- No technical skills are needed—just participate and enjoy the benefits!
