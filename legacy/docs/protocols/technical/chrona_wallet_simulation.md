# Simulation: Chrona Wallet & Economic Protocol User Flow

This simulation traces a typical user’s experience with the Chrona Wallet, from receiving UBI to making a transaction, surfacing integration points and blueprint gaps.

---

## 1. UBI Distribution
- **What happens:** The user receives a regular (e.g., weekly) deposit of Chrona into their wallet as Universal Basic Income.
- **Expected user experience:**
  - User is notified of new Chrona received.
  - Wallet balance is updated.
  - User can view the source and context of the deposit.
- **Blueprint check:**
  - Chrona UBI logic and schedule must be specified.
  - Wallet UI must show UBI as a distinct transaction type.
  - Audit trail for UBI distribution must be available.

## 2. Viewing Chrona Balance & History
- **What happens:** The user opens their Chrona Wallet to see their current balance and transaction history.
- **Expected user experience:**
  - Clear display of current Chrona balance, demurrage status, and TimeSteward rank.
  - Transaction history with context, source, and symbolic meaning for each entry.
  - Option to filter or search transactions.
- **Blueprint check:**
  - Wallet UI spec must include all required fields and visualizations.
  - Transaction model must support context and symbolic metadata.
  - Demurrage logic and display must be specified.

## 3. Making a Chrona Transaction
- **What happens:** The user sends Chrona to another user (e.g., as a gift, payment, or ritual).
- **Expected user experience:**
  - Ritualized, secure transfer flow with reflective prompts and confirmation.
  - Option to add a purpose memo and select related context.
  - Immediate update of both sender and recipient balances.
  - Transaction appears in both users’ histories with full traceability.
- **Blueprint check:**
  - Transaction creation and validation logic must be specified.
  - UI must support ritualized prompts and confirmations.
  - Audit and traceability for all transactions must be available.

## 4. Audit & Transparency
- **What happens:** The user reviews their Chrona activity for transparency and personal audit.
- **Expected user experience:**
  - Access to a full audit log of all Chrona activity.
  - Ability to export or share audit data if desired.
  - Clear explanations of demurrage, UBI, and transaction rules.
- **Blueprint check:**
  - Audit log endpoints and UI must be specified.
  - User education and help features must be included.

## Gaps & Recommendations
- [ ] Specify UBI distribution logic, schedule, and auditability in the blueprint.
- [ ] Ensure ChronaWallet and ChronaTransaction models support all required fields (context, symbolic meaning, demurrage, etc.).
- [ ] Complete Chrona Wallet UI spec, including ritualized flows and accessibility.
- [ ] Add/clarify audit and traceability endpoints for Chrona activity.
- [ ] Cross-link Chrona protocol, wallet UI, and economic governance docs.

*Update this simulation as the blueprint evolves. Use it to validate the Chrona economic flow and ensure a robust, user-friendly experience.*
