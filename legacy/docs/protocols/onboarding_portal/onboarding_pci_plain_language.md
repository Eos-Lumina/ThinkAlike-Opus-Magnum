# Plain-Language Guide: Onboarding & Persona Calibration (PCI) Journey

This guide explains, in simple terms, what a new user will experience when joining ThinkAlike and building their profile. No technical knowledge required!

---

## 1. Joining ThinkAlike
- You sign up and create your account.
- You are welcomed by Eos Lumina∴, a friendly guide who explains the project’s vision and values.

## 2. Giving Consent
- Before sharing any personal information, you are asked for your clear, specific consent.
- You can see exactly what you’re agreeing to and can change your mind at any time.

## 3. Building Your Persona Profile (PCI)
- You answer a few symbolic questions and share what matters most to you (your values, priorities, and stories).
- This helps the system understand you and match you with meaningful experiences and people.
- You can skip or revisit any part of this process.

## 4. Narrative Onboarding
- You participate in a short, interactive story (a “Narrative Duet”) with Eos Lumina∴ or another user.
- Your choices shape the story and help you connect with the community.

## 5. Transparency & Control
- You can always see what information you’ve shared and how it’s used.
- You can update, remove, or export your data at any time.
- All your actions are private, secure, and fully auditable.

---

**Why this matters:**
- You are in control of your data and experience.
- The system is designed for trust, transparency, and meaningful connection.
- No technical skills are needed—just curiosity and a willingness to explore!
