# Protocols Index

This directory contains all canonical, harmonized protocols for the ThinkAlike project. Each protocol defines standardized processes, ethical guidelines, and symbolic/ritual alignment for key areas such as AI safety, risk management, governance, identity, symbolic economy, and more. All protocols are PET/Clarity-aligned and support the Alchemical Interface Initiative.
