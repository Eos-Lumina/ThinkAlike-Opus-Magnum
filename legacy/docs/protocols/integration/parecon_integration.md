# Parecon Integration Protocol

## 1. Introduction
This protocol defines how Participatory Economics (Parecon) principles are operationalized within the ThinkAlike ecosystem, ensuring fair value flow, contribution tracking, and democratic governance.

## 2. Core Mechanisms
- Value accounting and distribution
- Contribution measurement (labor, creativity, stewardship)
- Collective decision-making and participatory planning
- Integration with Chrona wallet and marketplace

## 3. Integration Points
- **Chrona Wallet:** Value flows, UBI, intentional value
- **Hives:** Group-level planning, resource allocation
- **Marketplace:** Peer-to-peer exchange, service listing
- **Governance:** Proposal, voting, and feedback loops

## 4. Governance & Feedback
- Participatory budgeting
- Transparent audit trails
- Dispute resolution (see restorative trust protocol)

## 5. Open Questions / TODOs
- Finalize value/contribution metrics
- Specify participatory planning workflows
- Document integration with all relevant modules
