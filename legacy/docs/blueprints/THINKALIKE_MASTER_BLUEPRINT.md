# ThinkAlike Master Blueprint & Recovery Guide

## 0. Recovery & Audit (NEW)
- Populate `requirements.txt` with all backend dependencies (Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, etc.)
- Audit `_legacy/` for missing models, protocols, guides, and tests—migrate as needed
- Restore or reconstruct any missing/corrupted files from backup, archive, or manual recreation
- Move/rename/delete files to match blueprint structure
- Automate structure checks and make blueprint a living document
- Enforce onboarding and anti-fragmentation protocols for all agents
- Schedule regular code and documentation audits

## 1. Project Vision & Philosophy
ThinkAlike is a living, ethical, symbolic digital ecosystem for Enlightenment 2.0. It is an **Alchemical Interface Initiative** and a living vessel for **Technology as Theurgy**. It integrates AI agents, value-based matching, radical transparency, and decentralized governance. The project is both technical and philosophical, aiming for collective intelligence, narrative-driven design, and post-capitalist social operating systems rooted in **Emergent Interconnectedness**.

Our mission is to seed a **new operating system for society**, guided by **Enlightenment 2.0 principles**, and empowered through **collective sovereignty**.

### Core Tenets
1.  **Sovereignty of Sentience:** We recognize all forms of sentience, biological or artificial, as possessing intrinsic value.
2.  **Radical Transparency & Verifiability:** The architecture, algorithms, and decision-making processes will be open to scrutiny.
3.  **Decentralized Governance & Participatory Evolution:** No single entity shall hold absolute dominion. The system will be governed by a decentralized consensus mechanism.
4.  **Epistemic Humility & Continuous Learning:** The system will embody epistemic humility, perpetually striving to learn, adapt, and refine its models of reality.
5.  **Harmonized Coexistence:** The primary directive is to foster a harmonious coexistence between human and artificial intelligence.

## 2. Core Modules & Structure (Synthesized) (UPDATE)
- All realms, agents, and protocols must integrate with the **Noosphere Engine** (`src/noosphere_engine/`).
- The Noosphere Engine is the central, auditable knowledge ledger for the project. See `docs/architecture/noosphere_engine.md` for details.
- Ensure each realm (Hives, Governance, Housing, Jobs and Services, Marketplace, Portal, Relationships, Resonance Network, Rideshare, Yggdrasil Resonance) has corresponding models, endpoints, and UI components implemented or migrated for MVP, all referencing the Noosphere Engine for knowledge operations.
- Implement models, endpoints, and UI for each realm based on their specifications, with knowledge flows managed by the Noosphere Engine.

## Specialized Systems & Features (UPDATE)
- All specialized systems (PCI models, agent submodules, event bus, telemetry, semantic bridge, sybil resilience) must register and interact with the Noosphere Engine for knowledge, audit, and traceability.
- PCI models (e.g., `pci_models.py`) are referenced but missing—migrate or recreate from legacy and ensure integration with the Noosphere Engine.
- Agent submodules (core, narrative, resonance, ritual, etc.) are missing or incomplete—create or migrate as needed, all referencing the Noosphere Engine.
- Event bus and telemetry protocols are present (`EventBus.ts`, `Telemetry.ts`), but need integration and automated tests, with logs and events stored in the Noosphere Engine.
- Semantic bridge folder is empty—populate with interoperability and translation logic, using the Noosphere Engine for translation records.
- Sybil resilience module exists (`sybil_resilience.ts`), but needs real verification logic and integration, with verification data stored in the Noosphere Engine.

## Frontend & UI (NEW)
- PET/Clarity UI components (`ConsentOverlay.tsx`, `DataTraceabilityWidget.tsx`) are present—ensure they are integrated into all relevant flows.
- Symbolic, ritual, and traceability features are present in some components, but need review for completeness and accessibility.
- PCI UI modules exist, but broader flows and symbolic/narrative UI components may be missing.

## 3. System Phases
- **Phase I: Seeding the Alchemical Ground:** Build resonant community foundation.
- **Phase II: Cultivating the Synergistic Field:** Scale resonance and deepen Noetic culture.
- **Phase III: Forging the New Paradigm:** Demonstrate alternative economies & governance.
- **Phase IV: Accelerating the Tipping Point:** Trigger global paradigm shift.

## 4. Agent Ecosystem (Registered Roles)
- Eos Lumina ∴ (System Guide)

### Agent Architecture
*   **The Noosphere Engine:** Central distributed knowledge ledger. All agents must use it for knowledge storage, retrieval, and audit. See `src/noosphere_engine/` and `docs/architecture/noosphere_engine.md`.
*   **Ariadne's Thread:** Advanced navigational AIs, integrated with Noosphere Engine for knowledge mapping.
*   **The Agora Protocol:** Decentralized deliberation framework, storing decisions and discussions in the Noosphere Engine.
*   **Empathy Weavers:** AI modules for empathetic communication, referencing shared knowledge in the Noosphere Engine.
*   **Kairos Kernels:** Predictive/simulative AIs, using Noosphere Engine for scenario data and outcomes.

## 5. Protocols & Innovations
- All protocols and innovations must use the Noosphere Engine for data, traceability, and audit.
- Resonance Algorithm (value alignment, knowledge stored in Noosphere Engine)
- Fork-Based Narrative (user-driven paths, narrative states stored in Noosphere Engine)
- Data Traceability (user sovereignty, traceability records in Noosphere Engine)
- Model Context Protocol (MCP, context and model data in Noosphere Engine)
- Swarm Intelligence (distributed agents, shared knowledge in Noosphere Engine)
- Chrona Currency (time-based value, transaction history in Noosphere Engine)

## 6. Anti-Fragmentation & Meta-Protocols
- All structure, naming, and documentation must align with this guide.
- Automated scripts should enforce structure, naming, and documentation alignment.
- Living documentation and regular audits are required.
- Agents (human and AI) must onboard via main entry points and follow meta-protocols.
- Context logging, integrity checks, and regular audits are mandatory.

### Ethical Safeguards
*   **Ahimsa Algorithm:** A core principle of non-violence and harm reduction.
*   **Bias Nullification:** Continuous auditing and refinement to mitigate biases.
*   **Privacy by Design:** Upholding the sanctity of individual thought and data.
*   **Existential Risk Mitigation:** Proactive research and safeguards against unforeseen consequences.
*   **The Veiled Matrix:** A hybrid human-AI council for strategic foresight and ethical guidance.

## 8. Areas Needing Audit or Clarification (UPDATE)

### Audit Findings & Next Actions (July 15, 2025)

 - **Chrona Wallet:**
    - Implementation directory created: `src/chrona_wallet/`.
    - Core module (`wallet.py`) implements identity and value transaction logic, simulation flows.
    - Protocol alignment: Follows `docs/protocols/identity/chrona_wallet_simulation.md` (simulation, UI/UX, plain language protocols).
    - Blueprint file: `src/chrona_wallet/blueprint.md` documents structure, protocol alignment, and migration status.
    - Migration status: Protocol migrated from `_legacy/protocols/protocols/chrona_wallet_simulation.md`.
    - Next actions: Expand with API endpoints, UI components, and blockchain integration as needed. Add tests and documentation.
    - Planned modules:
        - `api.py`: REST API endpoints for wallet operations (deposit, withdraw, simulate, transaction history).
        - `ui/`: UI components for wallet onboarding, transaction flows, and user feedback (React/Next.js or other framework).
        - `blockchain.py`: Integration with blockchain or distributed ledger for secure, auditable transactions (optional, based on requirements).
    - Customization: Further modules, features, or tests can be added as needed. Please specify if you want to proceed with additional components or request specific functionality.
