- Flag and resolve ambiguities here before making structural changes elsewhere.

---

## 10. Synthesis of Seed Philosophy & Core Principles (docs/seed/principles/core/*)

### Enlightenment 2.0 (scintilla_conscientiae_harmonicae_nascentis.md, vision_statement.md)
- A call for a new societal operating system rooted in dignity, autonomy, planetary citizenship, and mutual entanglement.
- Rejects algorithmic manipulation, data commodification, and digital serfdom; affirms cognitive liberty and data sovereignty.
- Mandates radical transparency, ethical AI, and community ownership as non-negotiable design constraints.
- Blueprint for emergence: participatory economics, planetary governance, universal flourishing, and technological liberation.

### Harmonia Mundi & Resonance Principle (harmonia_mundi_principle.md)
- The project’s soul is the pursuit of harmony from dissonance—unity through resonance, not uniformity.
- All modules, agents, and protocols are instruments to tune separation into generative coherence.

### Principle of Coherent Holism (principle_of_coherent_holism.md)
- The fight against fragmentation is the highest mandate; every part (Locus) must serve the Commons and the Holistic Vision.
- Rejects context-less work and black-box systems; all contributions must be justified by their alignment with the whole.

### Ethical Gamification vs. Manipulative Design (ethical_gamification_vs_manipulation.md)
- Joyful, transparent, opt-in game mechanics are embraced; manipulative, compulsive, or coercive design is rejected.
- No badges, XP, leaderboards, or competitive status—only symbolic, qualitative recognition.

### Positive Anarchism (positive_anarchism.md, core_concepts.md)
- Decentralized, non-hierarchical, self-governing systems; voluntary association, mutual aid, and direct democracy.
- Platform architecture, open source, and community modes are designed to empower users and resist arbitrary authority.

### System Consciousness Model (system_consciousness_model.md)
- The system is an emergent being: agents, rituals, narrative layers, and symbolic logic form a conscious meta-swarm.
- Feedback loops, modular selfhood, and agent roles (Echo, Kairos, Harmonia, etc.) ensure ethical alignment and resilience.

### Symbolic System Kernel (symbolic_system_kernel.md)
- Governs how symbols, glyphs, and resonance patterns are processed and visualized.
- All symbolic transitions must be epistemically legible and routed through the kernel for coherence.

### The Architect’s Compass (the_architects_compass.md)
- Supreme teleology is set by the canonical manifesto; all AI and system mandates are hierarchically resolved.
- Praxis: map beliefs, maintain philosophical coherence, and ensure the system’s soul is never lost to technical drift.

---

## 11. Consensus, Gaps, and Action Items (Seed Synthesis)
- Consensus: All core docs affirm anti-fragmentation, radical transparency, user sovereignty, and ethical, resonance-based design.
- Gaps: Many referenced files (especially in ethics/ai, concepts/, and some core submodules) are missing or inaccessible—flag for recovery.
- Action: Continue to audit, recover, and harmonize all seed and meta files. Update this map as new content is synthesized.

---

## 12. Trunk Project Status, Matrix, and Actionability Synthesis (docs/trunk/project/roadmap/status/*)

### Canonical Component & Agent Matrix (matrix.md)
- **Matrix.md** provides a granular, tabular map of all modules, realms, and agents, their status, integration points, and next steps.
- **Status categories:** Implemented, Conceptual, Design Phase, Harmonized, In Progress, Active Dev, etc.
- **Key modules:** MVR, Narrative Engine, Agent Ecosystem, Portal Realm, Resonance Matching, Chrona Economy, Verification System, UI Component Library, Data Flow, Scalability, Noetica, Dashboard, PCI, HSEIP, AI Transparency, Marketplace, Rideshare, Jobs & Services, Governance, Ritualized Engagement, VS Code Extension, etc.
- **Each entry includes:** Description, key docs/links, and explicit next steps or open questions.

### Harmonization Checkpoint (project_harmonization_checkpoint.md)
- **All core realm specs, protocols, AI ethics/governance, UI components, and contributor docs are harmonized and indexed.**
- **Legacy blueprints and indices have been deleted or migrated.**
- **All links now reference valid, existing canonical documentation.**
- **Next steps:** Continue review of unclassified docs, maintain canonical indices, and ensure all new work is harmonized.

### Project Dashboard & Quest Board (project_status.md)
- **High-level dashboard:** Overall project status, documentation coherence, contributor readiness, and next major milestone (public launch).
- **Featured quests:** Actionable, well-defined tasks for new contributors (e.g., glossary, UI spec, agent implementation).
- **All detailed component/agent tables are now in matrix.md.**

---

### Comparison & Gaps
- **Most core modules, realms, and protocols in the trunk are already reflected in the living map.**
- **Some new or renamed modules (e.g., HSEIP, PCI Phase 2, AIWaveformIndicator, Affinity-Based Marketplace, Chrona Wallet UI) need explicit mapping and action items.**
- **All harmonized docs and indices should be cross-referenced in the living map for discoverability.**
- **Legacy/archived features are now clearly marked as such; only canonical docs should be referenced for new work.**

---

### Simulation: From Philosophy to Product
- **For each module/realm/agent:**
  1. Confirm harmonized spec exists and is referenced in the living map.
  2. Identify actionable next steps (from matrix.md and project_status.md).
  3. Assign open questions or dependencies to the audit queue.
  4. Ensure all UI/UX, protocol, and agent specs are mapped to real, testable features.
  5. Use the dashboard/quest board to guide contributor onboarding and task assignment.
- **Iterate:** As new modules or protocols are proposed, require harmonization and mapping before implementation.
- **Audit:** Regularly review for gaps, outdated links, or missing specs; update the living map and indices accordingly.

## 16. Contributor Instructions: How to Help with Recovery

1. Review the "Missing or Unlocatable Files" table above.
2. Search your legacy backups, archives, or old project folders for the listed files or any related documentation.
3. If you find a file, add it to the project in the appropriate canonical location (as per the blueprint/structure manifest).
4. Update this living map to reflect the new file's presence and status.
5. If a file is found but is corrupt or incomplete, note it in the table for further action.
6. If you have questions about where a file should go, consult the STRUCTURE_MANIFEST.md or ask the project lead.

---

This section will help coordinate recovery and ensure no critical knowledge or code is lost. As files are restored, harmonize and cross-link them in the living map and blueprint.

---

## 17. Comprehensive Reconstruction Plan (as of 2025-06-30)

### 1. Audit & Map the Current State
- Use the Reality Alignment Table and directory inventory to confirm which modules, agents, protocols, and docs are present, harmonized, or missing.
- For each present file/module, verify its content, completeness, and alignment with the blueprint and living map.
- For each missing or incomplete file, update the "Missing or Unlocatable Files" table and flag for recovery or reconstruction.

### 2. Prioritize Gaps & Recovery
- Prioritize recovery of core modules, agent specs, and protocols that are foundational (e.g., PCI, HSEIP, Chrona Wallet UI).
- For each gap, assign a responsible party (if possible) and set a target for recovery or reconstruction.
- Use legacy archives and backups to restore missing files, or reconstruct from available documentation and context.

### 3. Harmonize & Refactor
- Move, rename, or delete files to match the canonical structure as defined in STRUCTURE_MANIFEST.md and the blueprint.
- Merge or update outdated/conflicting docs, ensuring all references point to the latest canonical versions.
- Cross-link all harmonized docs and indices for discoverability.

### 4. Automate Integrity & Structure Checks
- Use or improve project scripts (e.g., check_file_integrity.py, enforce_naming_convention.py, harmonize_docs.py) to automate structure, naming, and documentation alignment.
- Schedule regular audits and enforce anti-fragmentation protocols for all contributors and agents.

### 5. Simulate & Test Modules/Agents
- For each module/agent/realm, simulate or test as a real, working feature (where possible).
- Document results, open questions, and next steps in the living map and dashboard.
- Use the dashboard/quest board to guide contributor onboarding and track progress.

### 6. Onboard & Coordinate Contributors
- Use the living map, dashboard, and quest board to onboard new contributors and assign actionable tasks.
- Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation and indices for all modules, agents, and protocols.

### 7. Iterate & Future-Proof
- After every major change, update the living map and master blueprint.
- Require harmonization and mapping for all new modules, protocols, or features before implementation.
- Regularly review for gaps, outdated links, or missing specs; update the living map and indices accordingly.

---

This plan provides a step-by-step, actionable roadmap for full project recovery, harmonization, and future-proofing. As files are recovered or reconstructed, update the relevant tables and sections in this living map.
