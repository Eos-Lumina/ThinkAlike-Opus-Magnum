# Persistent Storage & Multi-User State

## Vision
Transition ThinkAlike from in-memory demo state to robust, persistent, multi-user storage—enabling real collaboration, provenance, and swarm intelligence.

## Core Requirements
- **Database Integration:** Use a scalable database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite, or MongoDB) for rituals, narratives, agents, resonance, and sybil events.
- **Multi-User State:** All stateful modules (Ritual Engine, Narrative Engine, Agent Registry, etc.) must support concurrent users and persistent data.
- **Provenance & Audit:** All actions are logged with full provenance for PET/Clarity compliance.
- **Migration Plan:** Gradually refactor modules from in-memory to persistent storage, maintaining API contracts.

## Implementation Plan
1. Select and configure a database (start with SQLite for local/dev, plan for PostgreSQL in production).
2. Refactor Ritual Engine to use persistent storage for rituals and logs.
3. Refactor Narrative Engine, Agent Registry, Resonance Graph, and Sybil Resilience for persistent, multi-user state.
4. Update API endpoints to support multi-user queries and updates.
5. Ensure all provenance and PET/Clarity overlays reflect persistent data.

## Next Steps
- Scaffold a database connection and ORM (e.g., Prisma, TypeORM, or Mongoose).
- Refactor Ritual Engine as the first persistent module.
- Update documentation and source of truth after each migration.
