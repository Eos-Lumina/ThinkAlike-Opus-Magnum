# Website & Domain Plan

This document outlines the strategy for the project's public-facing website and domain.

## Domain

The official domain for the project is **ThinkAlike.org**. This domain has been registered and will be used for the primary project website.

## Website Strategy

Instead of directing users to the GitHub repository directly, a custom-built website will serve as the main entry point for the project. This website will be specifically designed to present the project's vision, goals, and features in a visually appealing and easily digestible format.

The primary goals of the website are:
- To provide a clear and compelling overview of the ThinkAlike project.
- To offer a centralized location for users to learn about the project.
- To provide a clear and easy way for users to download the project repository.

## Implementation Options

There are several options for building and hosting the project website.

### üîß Option 1: GitHub Pages (Perfect for Static Sites)

A custom visual website can be created using HTML/CSS/JS and hosted for free with GitHub Pages.

**Flow:**
1.  Create a new branch or folder in the repository (or a separate repository) with the website files.
2.  Add an `index.html` file as the homepage.
3.  In the GitHub repository settings, go to **Settings > Pages**, and choose the branch/folder to publish.
4.  Add a download button linking to the project's `.zip` archive or the GitHub repository itself.

**Example Download Link:**
```html
<a href="https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" download>Download Project</a>
```

For a more styled layout, a static site generator like Jekyll or Hugo can be used.

### üåê Option 2: Netlify / Vercel / Cloudflare Pages

For more flexibility or to use modern web frameworks like React, Vue, or Next.js, platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or Cloudflare Pages are excellent choices.

**Features:**
- Custom domain support
- Free SSL certificates
- Seamless integration with GitHub for continuous deployment

**Flow:**
1.  Push the site code to the GitHub repository.
2.  Connect the repository to Netlify, Vercel, or Cloudflare Pages.
3.  The platform will automatically build and deploy the site.
4.  Add a download link or a GitHub badge to guide users to the repository.

### üß© Bonus: Templates to Jumpstart Development

To accelerate the development of the landing page, free templates can be used from sources like:
- **HTML5 UP**
- **Start Bootstrap**
- **GitHub Pages themes**

These templates provide a solid foundation that can be customized to fit the project's branding and style.
