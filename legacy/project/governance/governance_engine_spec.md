# 🏛️ Governance Engine Specification

This specification defines how decisions are made, moderated, and reversed within the ThinkAlike ecosystem. It supports both consensus-driven processes and minority voice preservation.

---

## 🧭 Design Principles

- Consent > control  
- Visibility > authority  
- Participation weighted by contribution, not capital  
- Modular logic allows governance per module or across global system

---

## 🧩 Components

- **Proposal Engine**: structured decision requests  
- **Voice Weighting**: balanced by past contributions (Chrona, care, effort)  
- **Moderation Tools**: collective flagging + AI-assisted resolution  
- **Dispute Pathways**: transparency-first fallback escalation

---

## 🔗 Integrations

- `active_task_board.md` — contributor governance power  
- `feature_document_matrix.md` — protocol-level module voting  
- `e2.0_certification_process.md` — trust-based voting access  
- `resonance_network_module.md` — value-aligned policy matching
