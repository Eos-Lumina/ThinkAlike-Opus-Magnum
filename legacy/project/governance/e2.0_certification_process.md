# 🏛️ Enlightenment 2.0 Certification Process

This file outlines the symbolic and practical framework behind **ThinkAlike’s trust system**, called Enlightenment 2.0 Certification. It rewards coherence, care, and contribution — not profit, power, or conformity.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

- Certify contributors, agents, organizations, or modules as aligned with the Clarity Protocol  
- Provide symbolic trust signals for governance, matchmaking, and public endorsement  
- Create non-competitive recognition that reflects values and care, not hierarchy

---

| `AI Agent Aligned`       | Fully obeys traceability and zero-assumption policy |
| `Org Ecosystem Compliant`| Proven data sovereignty and ethical contracts |
| `Module Certified`       | Design validated by community and symbolic review |
