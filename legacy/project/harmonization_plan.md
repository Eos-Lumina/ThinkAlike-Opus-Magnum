# ThinkAlike Project Harmonization & Anti-Fragmentation Plan

## Purpose
To eliminate duplication, ambiguity, and fragmentation across the ThinkAlike project by enforcing canonical structure, single sources of truth, and automated structure-awareness for all agents and contributors.

---

## 1. Canonical Structure Enforcement
- **Maintain a single canonical folder for each major domain:**
  - UI Components: `docs/ui_components/`
  - Onboarding/Bootstrapping: `docs/onboarding/`
  - Contributor Guides: `docs/contributors/`
  - Protocols/Specs: `docs/protocols/`
  - Style & Templates: `docs/style/`, `docs/templates/`
  - Data, Assets, Scripts: `data/`, `assets/`, `scripts/`
- **All other locations for these domains must be deprecated, redirected, or removed.**

## 2. Reference & Cross-Linking
- **All guides, specs, and onboarding docs must reference the canonical folder and index for their domain.**
- **Deprecated or legacy files/folders must be clearly marked and cross-linked to the canonical source.**

## 3. Automated Structure Checks
- **Implement and run scripts to:**
  - Detect duplicate or ambiguous files/folders (e.g., multiple onboarding, contributor, or UI component docs)
  - Identify non-canonical or legacy files/folders
  - Generate and update a canonical file map (`PROJECT_FILE_INDEX.md`)
- **Integrate structure checks into CI/CD and agent workflows.**

## 4. Agent & Contributor Protocols
- **Update agent onboarding/bootstrapping protocols to require:**
  - Reference to the latest `PROJECT_FILE_INDEX.md` before any file/folder creation or update
  - Structure-awareness and cross-checks for all actions
  - Use of canonical templates and style guides
- **Require contributors to follow the same reference and harmonization protocols.**

## 5. Deprecation & Migration
- **Migrate all content from non-canonical folders to their canonical location.**
- **Remove or archive empty, outdated, or redundant files (e.g., old file lists, legacy onboarding scripts).**
- **Add deprecation notices and cross-links to any remaining legacy files.**

## 6. README & Index Consistency
- **Ensure each major domain has only one canonical README/index file.**
- **Remove or redirect all redundant or outdated README/index files.**

## 7. Ongoing Harmonization
- **Schedule regular harmonization sweeps using automated scripts.**
- **Update the harmonization plan and structure map as the project evolves.**

---

## Immediate Action Items
1. **Run structure check scripts and generate a report of all duplicates, ambiguous files, and non-canonical locations.**
2. **Migrate or deprecate all non-canonical files/folders as per this plan.**
3. **Update all guides, onboarding, and agent protocols to reference this harmonization plan and the canonical file map.**
4. **Integrate structure-awareness checks into agent and contributor onboarding.**
