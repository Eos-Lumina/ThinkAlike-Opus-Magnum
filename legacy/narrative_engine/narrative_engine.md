# Narrative Engine

The Narrative Engine is a core module of the ThinkAlike architecture responsible for generating, managing, and harmonizing the evolving narrative context within the system. It enables agents and users to collaboratively construct, refine, and explore knowledge through structured storytelling, contextual linking, and resonance-driven feedback.

## Purpose

- Facilitate the emergence of coherent, meaningful narratives from distributed contributions.
- Support context-aware reasoning, memory, and knowledge evolution.
- Enable traceable, transparent, and auditable narrative construction.

## Core Principle: Dynamic Presentation of Static Structures

- **Dynamic Personalization on a Static Foundation:** The Narrative Engine operates on a foundation of well-defined, static narrative blocks, choices, and scenarios (`PortalNarrativeStructure`). However, the *path* a user takes through these structures, the *specific content* Eos Lumina∴ chooses to present (e.g., which riddle from the pool), and the *thematic framing* of the narration are all dynamically tailored in real-time.
- **Driven by `UserValueProfile`:** This tailoring is driven by the user's evolving `UserValueProfile` and "Resonance Fingerprint." The engine selects the most resonant and relevant narrative blocks to present next, creating a unique journey for each user.

## Key Features

- **Personalized Story Weaving:** Integrates agent/user contributions and selects pre-defined narrative blocks to weave a unique, personalized narrative thread for each user, based on their `UserValueProfile`.
- **Resonance-Driven Pathing:** Uses resonance signals to guide the user's path through the static narrative structure, selecting dilemmas, reflections, and 'Gnostic Transmissions' from the `AI Personalized Teaching Engine` that are most relevant to their emergent archetypes and values.
- **Resonance Feedback Loop:** Utilizes resonance signals (agreement, novelty, relevance) to guide narrative evolution and highlight emergent insights.
- **Forking and Merging:** Supports narrative branching (forks) and subsequent merging, enabling parallel exploration and synthesis of ideas.
- **Traceability:** Maintains links to source data, agent actions, and decision points for auditability and learning.
- **Narrative Metrics:** Computes metrics such as coherence, entropy, and resonance to assess narrative health and guide interventions.

## Architecture Overview

- **Input:** Agent/user contributions, context signals, resonance feedback, data references.
- **Processing:**
  - Narrative thread construction and update
  - Contextual linking and memory integration
  - Resonance analysis and feedback propagation
  - Fork/merge management
- **Output:** Updated narrative state, traceability records, resonance metrics, context manifests.

## Integration Points

- **Resonance Module:** For feedback signals and narrative health metrics.
- **Data Traceability Module:** For linking narrative elements to source data and agent actions.
- **Verification Module:** For validating narrative integrity and coherence.
- **Forking Module:** For managing narrative branches and merges.
- **System Narrative:** Symbolic and mythic context provided by the [ThinkAlike System Narrative](canon/thinkalike_system_narrative.md).
- **Archetypal Lens Matrix:** For understanding user archetypal alignments which inform narrative personalization and triggers (see `../../seed/symbolic_alignment/archetypal_lens_matrix.md`).

## Example Workflow

1. User or agent submits a narrative contribution.
2. Engine integrates the contribution, updates context, and computes resonance.
3. Forks or merges are created as needed, with traceability maintained.
4. Updated narrative state is made available to agents, users, and UI.

## Design Principles

- **Transparency:** All narrative changes are logged and auditable.
- **Resonance-Driven:** Evolution guided by alignment, novelty, and coherence.
- **Collaborative:** Supports distributed, multi-agent contributions.
- **Symbolic/Ritual Framing:** Narrative construction is guided by symbolic logic, ritual consent, and user archetypal understanding (see `archetypal_lens_matrix.md`), with council oversight for major protocol changes.
