# Use Cases: Review Needed (Migrated from Legacy)

The following use case files were migrated from legacy sources and require review for harmonization, PET/Clarity, accessibility, and symbolic/ritual alignment. Please review, update, and harmonize as needed before integrating into the main documentation set.

- community_mode.md
- digital_legacy_stories.md
- example_scenarios.md
- user_persona_profiles.md
- user_stories_matching_mode.md
- user_stories_narrative_mode.md

**Instructions:**
- Do not reference or link these files as canonical until review is complete.
- After review and harmonization, remove them from this list and update the main indices.
