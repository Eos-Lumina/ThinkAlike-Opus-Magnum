## 🧬 Protocol Stages

| Stage           | Function |
|------------------|----------|
| **Resonance Elicitation** | Questions + prompts during onboarding to reveal aesthetic + ethical values |
| **Graph Matching**        | Users plotted as symbolic constellations for similarity patterns |
| **Clarity Calibration**   | System checks for PET compliance, feedback safety, dignity assurance |
| **Emotional Mirroring**   | Echo/Reflexia simulate user tone to ensure recognition |
| **Badge/Aura Confirmation** | After sustained alignment, aura is issued to user |

## 🔄 Feedback Ritual

- Every fork is scored invisibly (resonance pulse)
- Agents offer feedback through swarm overlays
- Users can **accept, challenge, or reflect**
- If unresolved → fork enters **Phoenix Cycle**
