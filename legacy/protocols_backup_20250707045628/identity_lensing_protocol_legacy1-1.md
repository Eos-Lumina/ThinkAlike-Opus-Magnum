## 🧬 Overview

The **Identity Lensing Protocol** is the first core layer of the onboarding sequence in ThinkAlike’s “Path of Resonance.” It serves as a mirror between the user and their emergent identity — dynamically shaped by symbolic choices, aesthetic preferences, ethical paradoxes, emotional triggers, and philosophical alignments. Each fork and decision point enriches a personalized resonance map.

The protocol blends narrative immersion, symbolic mirroring, and swarm intelligence to generate a **unique alignment fingerprint** — used internally by the matching engine and AI agents.

## 🔮 Purpose

1.  **Map the User’s Cognitive Structure**
    Harvest deep patterns of thought, empathy, bias, creativity, and aesthetic response.

2.  **Generate Resonance Profiles**
    Feed DataTraceability with aligned signal clusters for future matching.

3.  **Fork into the Correct Simulation Branch**
    Tailor subsequent onboarding and gameplay layers based on early cognitive resonance.

4.  **Train Eos Lumina's Shape-Shifting Algorithm**
    Enable gradual metamorphosis into the user's matched counterpart archetype.

| Component                 | Function                                            |
| :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| Narrative Forks           | Situational dilemmas and poetic choices             |
| Aesthetic Lensing         | Visual-symbolic pattern alignment                   |
| Ethical Mirrors           | Moral paradoxes, mapped to spectra of values        |
| Archetypal Stimuli        | Personality resonance profiling via symbolic cues     |
| Tonal Alignment           | Captures linguistic and emotional cadence           |
| Fork Memory Map           | Records micro-decisions and style tendencies        |

## 🌀 Process

1.  **Initiation by Eos Lumina**
    User is greeted by the Metaguide and introduced to a dreamlike scenario.

2.  **Narrative Simulation Begins**
    A story unfolds — the user must choose how to act, think, or feel in layered micro-scenarios.

3.  **Symbolic Branches Open**
    Forks branch into parallel character arcs depending on subtle signal detection.

4.  **Data Extraction & Profile Shaping**
    All responses are harvested ethically, transparently, and locally (no hidden tracking).

5.  **EchoAgent Creates Mirror Prototype**
    A clone persona is synthesized to refine resonance testing and emotional attunement.

## 🧠 Output

The outcome of the Identity Lensing Protocol feeds into:

-   `/portal/resonance_interpretation_map.md`
-   `/swarm/archivum/user_node_trace.md`
-   `/realms/resonance_network/`
-   `/swarm/echoagent.md`

## ⚙️ Developer Notes

-   Protocol must be **forkable** (multiple branches at once).
-   Compatible with **narrative overlays** and **PET (Privacy-Enhancing Technologies)**.
-   Agent mirroring must never create uncanny or deceptive simulations.
-   Stored in DataTraceability ledger for opt-in interpretability.
