## 1. Introduction
The Chrona Wallet is the core digital wallet for the ThinkAlike ecosystem, enabling users to manage value, participate in economic flows, and interact securely with all system protocols.

## 2. Architecture Overview
- **Data Model:**
  - User identity and wallet address schema
  - Ledger structure (transaction history, balances, value types)
  - Integration with UBI, intentional value, and Parecon flows
- **Security:**
  - Encryption standards for keys and sensitive data
  - Authentication and recovery mechanisms
  - Audit trails and traceability

## 3. Features
- Value storage and transfer (multi-asset support)
- UBI (Universal Basic Income) distribution and tracking
- Intentional value creation and allocation
- Transaction signing and verification
- Integration with hives, marketplace, and governance modules

## 4. UI/UX Requirements
- Intuitive dashboard for balances, transactions, and value flows
- Onboarding and recovery flows
- Security and privacy controls
- Accessibility and localization

## 5. Integration Points
- **Economic Protocols:** UBI, Parecon, marketplace
- **Governance:** Voting, proposals, dispute resolution
- **APIs:** REST/OpenAPI endpoints for wallet operations

## 6. Implementation Notes
- Reference OpenAPI specs in `docs/api_specs/`
- Ensure compliance with data sovereignty and traceability principles
- Cross-link to restorative trust and dispute resolution protocols

## 7. Open Questions / TODOs
- Finalize data model and ledger structure
- Specify cryptographic standards
- Define onboarding and recovery UX in detail
- Document integration with all economic and governance flows
