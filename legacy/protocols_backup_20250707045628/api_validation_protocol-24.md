# ThinkAlike API Validation Protocol – Symbolic, Ritual, and PET/Clarity Aligned

This protocol defines the canonical approach to API validation for the ThinkAlike platform, harmonizing schema, business, and ethical validation across backend and frontend, and surfacing results in a PET/Clarity and symbolic/ritual-aligned manner. It ensures robust accessibility, auditability, and extensibility for all API interactions.

## 1. Validation Principles & PET/Clarity Alignment
- **Transparency:** All validation logic, outcomes, and errors are surfaced to developers and, where appropriate, to users.
- **Explicit Consent:** Validation of user data and actions always checks for explicit, context-aware consent.
- **Ethical Alignment:** All API flows are validated for alignment with core values (see CoreValuesValidator), including privacy, user empowerment, and bias mitigation.
- **Auditability:** All validation events are logged with trace IDs and symbolic/ritual metadata for audit trails.
- **Accessibility:** Validation feedback (errors, warnings, confirmations) must be accessible (WCAG AAA), with clear, non-color-only cues and ARIA support.

## 2. Validation Layers & Data Flow
- **Backend (API):**
  - Schema validation (OpenAPI, Pydantic/FastAPI, etc.)
  - Business logic validation (domain rules, state, permissions)
  - Ethical validation (core values, PET/Clarity, symbolic overlays)
