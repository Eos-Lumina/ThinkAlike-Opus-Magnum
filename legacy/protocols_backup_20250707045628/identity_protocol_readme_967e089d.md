## üß≠ Purpose

The `identity_protocol/` folder defines the philosophical, technical, and social architecture of identity in the ThinkAlike system. It transitions identity from a state-bound, static artifact into a **fluid, forkable, value-aligned construct** embedded within a **post-national digital commons**.

This protocol integrates self-sovereign identity (SSI), verifiable credentials (VCs), decentralized identifiers (DIDs), and resonance-based matching to form the foundation of participation, trust, and civic structure in the ThinkAlike ecosystem.
