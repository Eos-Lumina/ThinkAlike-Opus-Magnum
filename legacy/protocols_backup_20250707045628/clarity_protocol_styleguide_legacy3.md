# Clarity Protocol: Visual Identity Style Guide (Harmonized)

**Clarity is not a style; it is a protocol.** This document defines the official visual identity system for ThinkAlike, codified as the **Clarity Protocol**. It governs UI color, motion, fonts, interaction metaphors, and symbolic design across all modules, ensuring PET/Clarity, accessibility, and ritual alignment.

---

## 1. Aesthetic Philosophy

- Clean, modern, cosmic
- Glyphic and symbolic, yet accessible
- Harmonious balance of color, light, space
- Subtle, layered animation and interaction
- Emotionally resonant, never corporate
- Symbolic/ritual intent: All visual elements serve the "Alchemical Interface Initiative" and reinforce swarm unity.

- **Secondary Font (Body):** [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) (400)
- **Special:** Use 'Aldrich' for Eos Lumina∴ branding; fallback to Montserrat/Open Sans for ∴ if unsupported.

---

## 4. Iconography & Glyphs

- Glyphic symbolism only (never skeuomorphic)
- Subtle stroke-based vector shapes or animated glyphs
- All glyphs must have alt tags for accessibility

---

## 5. Motion System

| Element         | Behavior               | Notes                                  |

| Triangle       | Smooth fade on lock    | Appears only at connection             |
| Glyphs         | Gentle float, phase-in | Used in rituals, dream mapping         |

---

## 6. UI Structure

- **Node Map:** Resonance network and identity constellation visualizations
- **Onboarding:** Portal-style screen with light-based navigation
- **Tables:** Open Sans font, 2px spacing, alternating grays

---

## 7. PET/Clarity & Accessibility Alignment

- All visual elements must meet or exceed WCAG AAA standards.
- Symbolic/ritual intent and PET/Clarity principles must be explicit in all UI/UX work.

---

## 8. Visual Manifesto

> "Beauty and resonance are not ornament. They are protocol."

Clarity is a symbolic function. All forks, interfaces, and modules must preserve this visual system to remain in the Hive.
