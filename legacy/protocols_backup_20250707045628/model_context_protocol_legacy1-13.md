## 🧠 Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## 🧭 Purpose

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) establishes a universal, transparent, and ethically auditable context management system for all AI agents, modules, and user-facing features in ThinkAlike. MCP ensures:

- **Unified Context:** All agents and modules operate with a shared, up-to-date context, reducing fragmentation and misalignment.
- **Ethical Traceability:** Every context change is logged, attributed, and auditable for bias, fairness, and compliance with PET (Privacy-Enhancing Technologies) standards.
- **User Agency:** Users can view, edit, and revoke context elements that pertain to their identity, preferences, and data.
- **Modular Interoperability:** Context is structured for seamless exchange between modules, agents, and external integrations.

---

## 🏗️ Core Components

- **Context Graph:** A dynamic, versioned graph structure representing all relevant entities, relationships, and states.
- **Audit Log:** Immutable, timestamped records of all context changes, including agent/user, reason, and diff.
- **Access Control Layer:** Fine-grained permissions for reading, writing, and sharing context elements.
- **PET Overlay:** Privacy-preserving mechanisms (e.g., encryption, masking, ZK-proofs) applied to sensitive context data.
- **Context API:** Standardized interface for agents and modules to query, update, and subscribe to context changes.

---

## 🔄 Protocol Flow

1. **Context Initialization:** Onboarding or session start loads the relevant context graph for the user/agent.
2. **Context Query:** Agents/modules request context via the Context API, receiving only what they are permitted to access.
3. **Context Update:** Any change (user action, agent inference, external event) is proposed, validated, and logged.
4. **Audit & Review:** All changes are visible in the audit log, with tools for diffing, rollback, and ethical review.
5. **Context Sync:** Updates propagate to all relevant modules/agents in real time, ensuring system-wide coherence.

---

## 🛡️ Ethical & Security Guarantees

- **Transparency:** All context flows are visible and auditable by users and governance agents.
- **Privacy:** PET overlays ensure sensitive data is protected by default.
- **Consent:** No context is shared or modified without explicit, revocable user consent.
- **Resilience:** The protocol is robust against tampering, unauthorized access, and context poisoning.

---

## 🌐 Integration & Extensibility

- **Module Plug-in:** Any new module or agent can register with the MCP, inheriting context standards and auditability.
- **External Systems:** Bridges for federated identity, external data sources, and cross-platform context sharing.
- **Governance Hooks:** Integration with governance engine for policy enforcement, dispute resolution, and collective oversight.

---

## 📖 Example Use Cases

- **Resonance Matching:** Ensures all matching algorithms operate on the same, up-to-date user context, with full audit trails.
- **AI Agent Collaboration:** Multiple agents can coordinate actions and recommendations using a shared, ethical context.
- **User Data Portability:** Users can export, review, and migrate their context data across modules or platforms.
- **Ethical Auditing:** Governance agents can review all context changes for compliance, bias, and user rights.
