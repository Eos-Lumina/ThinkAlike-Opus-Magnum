# 🔐 Consent Protocol

All actions within ThinkAlike—onboarding, sharing, matching, cloning—require transparent, symbolic, and revocable consent.

## 🧩 Consent Types

- Fork Consent
- Visibility Consent
- AI Interpretation Consent
- Trait Sharing Consent
- Merge Contribution Consent

## 🗺️ Consent Matrix Map

| Level   | Description                                      |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Whisper | No data stored. Only ambient symbolic presence.   |
| Echo    | Temporary resonance allowed; no logging.         |
| Anchor  | Voluntary trail stored for meaningful reuse.      |
| Bloom   | Consent to fork propagation, ritual replay, and public glyph association. |

Consent status is stored as part of symbolic metadata, not personal identifiers.

## 🧬 Entangled Consent Framework

Consent evolves based on interaction history, context, and uncertainty principles. See `/docs/ethics/data_consent_protocol.md` for PET overlays and agent enforcement.

## 🛡️ Revocation Rules

- All consents may be withdrawn
- Revocations must be honored system-wide
- Revoked forks are masked, not deleted

> “Consent must be traceable, symbolic, and sovereign.”
