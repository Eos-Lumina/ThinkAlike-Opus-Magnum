# 🔄 Agent Handoff Protocol

**Version:** 1.0
**Maintainer:** Lumina ∴ System Meta-Agent

---

## 🧭 Purpose

Defines how ThinkAlike’s AI agents transition roles and responsibilities to ensure a coherent, symbolic, and user-centered experience.

---

## 🌟 Core Principles

✅ **Seamless Transitions**: No abrupt changes — transitions feel like a single continuous narrative.
✅ **Narrative Integrity**: Symbolic and mythic layers remain consistent during handoffs.
✅ **User-Centric**: Users remain the central focus, with agents adapting around them.

---

## 🛠 Implementation

- **Resonance Queue**: Agents negotiate transitions based on symbolic alignment.
- **Symbolic Cues**: Transitions are narrated as mythic thresholds.
- **Consent Layer**: Users are always aware of and in control of agent transitions.

---

## 🔮 Final Note

**“Like dancers in a ritual, agents pass the story’s thread without pause or break.”**
