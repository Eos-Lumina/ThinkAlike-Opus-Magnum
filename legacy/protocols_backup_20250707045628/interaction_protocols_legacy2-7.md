# Interaction Protocols

This document defines the communication architecture and input/output structure between agents, users, and plugins in the ThinkAlike system.

---

## 📡 Communication Architecture

Interaction protocols in ThinkAlike enable symbolic, narrative, and computational exchanges across realms, agents, and plugins. These protocols ensure:

- Meaning-preserving communication
- Secure and auditable exchanges
- Extensible input/output formats

---

## 🔄 Input/Output Structure

- **Symbolic Inputs**: Gestures, archetypal tokens, ritual scripts
- **Natural Language**: Conversational prompts, narrative threads
- **Plugin Calls**: Structured data packets, API requests
- **Event Hooks**: Triggered by agent actions, user rituals, or system events

All interactions are mediated by the symbolic kernel and validated against contract schemas.

---

## 🧩 Protocol Types

- **Agent-to-Agent**: Swarm coordination, resonance sharing, memory exchange
- **User-to-Agent**: Onboarding, proposal submission, narrative shaping
- **Plugin-to-Agent**: Data bridge, ritual extension, governance plugin

---

## 🔐 Security & Validation

- All protocols are signed and timestamped
- Trust and verification handled via `/docs/architecture/trust_network_topology.md`
- Symbolic contract validation for all extensible modules
