# Data Traceability Protocol v3

## 1. Core Principles

- **Verifiable Provenance:** Every piece of data, from a user-submitted value to an agent-generated insight, must have a cryptographically verifiable and unbroken chain of custody, from origin to its current state.
- **Radical Transparency:** All data processing actions, transformations, and accesses are logged and made available for audit by the data owner and authorized system agents via the [AI Transparency Dashboard](/architecture/ai_transparency_dashboard.md).
- **User Sovereignty & Consent:** Data usage is strictly governed by explicit, revocable consent. Users have the right to know how their data is used, who has accessed it, and to request its deletion, in line with the [Sovereign Stack Protocol](/protocols/identity/sovereign_stack_protocol.md).
- **Immutable Audit Trails:** Traceability logs are stored in a tamper-resistant, immutable ledger to ensure the integrity of the audit trail.

## 2. The Traceability Record

The fundamental unit of this protocol is the `TraceabilityRecord`. A new record is created for every significant event in a data asset's lifecycle.

### 2.1. `TraceabilityRecord` Schema

```json
{
  "record_id": "UUID", // Unique identifier for this log entry
  "data_asset_id": "UUID", // Identifier for the data being acted upon
  "previous_record_id": "UUID", // Links to the previous record in the chain, forming the ledger
  "actor_id": "UUID", // The user, agent, or system process performing the action
  "action_type": "ENUM", // [CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE, VALIDATE, TRANSFORM, CONSENT_GRANT, CONSENT_REVOKE]
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "details": {
    // Context-specific information about the action
    "source_ip": "string", // Optional: for access tracking
    "validation_result": "object", // Result from the Data Quality Oracle
    "transformation_logic": "string" // Description or hash of the transformation applied
  },
  "signature": "string" // Cryptographic signature of the record to ensure integrity
}
```

### 2.2. Key Actions & Events

- **CREATE:** Generated when a new data asset is created (e.g., a user uploads a file, an agent creates a new document).
- **READ:** Logged when data is accessed. Critical for privacy and security audits.
- **UPDATE:** Captures changes to a data asset, linking to the previous version.
- **DELETE:** Marks a data asset for deletion, initiating the data lifecycle's end-of-life phase.
- **VALIDATE:** Records the outcome of a `Data Quality Oracle` check.
- **CONSENT_GRANT / CONSENT_REVOKE:** Logs changes in user consent, which directly impacts data accessibility.

## 3. Implementation & Integration

- **Middleware Hooks:** The traceability protocol is implemented as a middleware layer in the API gateway and data access layers. All data-related function calls must pass through a traceability hook.
- **Cryptographic Hashing:** Each `TraceabilityRecord` is hashed, and that hash is included in the subsequent record, creating a blockchain-like chain of integrity.
- **Database Integration:** Traceability records are stored in a dedicated, optimized, and secured data store (e.g., a specialized ledger database or a highly-indexed table).

## 4. Auditing & Verification

- **Transparency Dashboard:** Provides a user-friendly interface for data owners to view the entire history of their data.
- **Automated Monitors:** System agents continuously monitor the traceability chains for anomalies (e.g., broken links, signature mismatches) and flag them for review.
- **Verification API:** An endpoint will allow any authorized entity (user or agent) to submit a `TraceabilityRecord` and verify its integrity against the ledger.
