# Data Quality Oracle Protocol

## 1. Purpose

The Data Quality Oracle is the validation and assurance engine for all data flowing through ThinkAlike Realms. It enforces standards for data completeness, accuracy, and ethical provenance, supporting User Sovereignty, Radical Transparency, and Enlightenment 2.0 principles.

## 2. Guiding Principles

- **Completeness:** All required data fields must be present and non-null.
- **Accuracy:** Data is validated against expected formats, value ranges, and ontological consistency.
- **Provenance:** Every data point is traceable to its source and validation history, in accordance with the [Data Traceability Protocol](/protocols/data/data_traceability_protocol_v3.md).
- **Ethical Data Handling:** No data is accepted or processed without explicit user consent and transparent logging.

## 3. Core Validation Protocols

- **Existence Checks:** Ensures all required fields (e.g., `filepath`, `creator_id`) exist in every record.
- **Null Checks:** No critical fields may be null; missing data is flagged for review or rejection.
- **Format & Range Validation:** Data is checked for correct types, formats (e.g., ISO 8601 dates), and allowed value ranges.
- **Ontological Consistency:** Validates that data relationships adhere to the defined [Data Ontology](/architecture/data_ontology.md).
- **Audit Logging:** All validation actions are logged for transparency and review, creating a `ValidationRecord` linked to the data's traceability chain.

## 4. Example Validation Suite

A validation suite defines the expectations for a given data type. These are machine-readable specifications used by the Oracle.

```json
{
  "expectation_suite_name": "canonical_document_quality_suite",
  "expectations": [
    { "expectation_type": "expect_column_to_exist", "kwargs": { "column": "title" } },
    { "expectation_type": "expect_column_values_to_not_be_null", "kwargs": { "column": "title" } },
    { "expectation_type": "expect_column_values_to_be_in_set", "kwargs": { "column": "status", "value_set": ["Draft", "Review", "Canonical", "Archived"] } },
    { "expectation_type": "expect_column_values_to_match_regex", "kwargs": { "column": "version", "regex": "^\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+$" } }
  ]
}
```

## 5. Integration Points

- **Orchestration Engine:** Invokes the Data Quality Oracle at key workflow stages, such as before persisting a new document or processing an agent action.
- **API Endpoints:** All data submitted via APIs is validated by the Oracle before being accepted.
- **Data Traceability:** Validation results (success or failure) are cryptographically linked to the data's record in the traceability chain.
