# Akashic Record Protocol

## 1. Vision & Purpose

This protocol defines the rules and procedures for interacting with the Akashic Record, the decentralized, immutable, and permanent storage layer of the ThinkAlike ecosystem. The Akashic Record serves as the ultimate source of truth for all significant events, interactions, and data provenance.

The purpose of this protocol is to ensure that all data committed to the Akashic Record is done so in a standardized, verifiable, and secure manner, preserving the integrity and trustworthiness of the system's collective memory.

## 2. Protocol Specification

### 2.1. Record Structure

-   **Unit of Storage**: The fundamental unit of storage in the Akashic Record is the **Traceability Record**, as defined in the [Data Architecture](/architecture/data_architecture.md).
-   **Immutability**: Once a record is successfully committed to the Akashic Record, it MUST be considered immutable and cannot be altered or deleted. Corrections or updates MUST be handled by committing a new record that supersedes the old one, with a clear link to the original record's ID.
-   **Content Addressing**: All records MUST be content-addressed, meaning the unique identifier for a record is a cryptographic hash of its contents. This ensures data integrity and prevents duplication.

### 2.2. Writing to the Record

-   **Authorization**: Only authorized system components (e.g., the Agent Orchestrator, specific core services) are permitted to write to the Akashic Record.
-   **Validation**: Before being committed, every record MUST be validated by the [Data Quality Oracle Protocol](/protocols/data/data_quality_oracle_protocol.md). Records that fail validation MUST be rejected.
-   **Provenance**: Every record MUST include a complete provenance trail, as specified by the [Data Traceability Protocol](/protocols/data/data_traceability_protocol.md). This includes the originating entity, the sequence of transformations, and the purpose of the data.
-   **Batching**: To optimize performance, records MAY be batched together and committed as a single transaction. However, each record within the batch must be individually validatable.

### 2.3. Reading from the Record

-   **Access Control**: Read access to the Akashic Record is governed by the system's privacy and consent protocols. Users generally have read access only to their own data and public records.
-   **Querying**: The protocol supports querying the Akashic Record based on record ID, timestamp range, source entity, or other indexed metadata fields.
-   **Verification**: When a record is read, the client SHOULD verify its integrity by re-calculating its cryptographic hash and comparing it to its content-addressed identifier.

## 3. Integration with Core Systems

-   **Data Architecture**: This protocol is the implementation of the storage and provenance principles outlined in the [Data Architecture](/architecture/data_architecture.md).
-   **AI Transparency**: The [AI Transparency Dashboard](/architecture/ai_transparency_dashboard.md) directly sources its event logs from the Akashic Record, providing users with a verifiable history of AI actions.
-   **Economic Layer**: All `Chrona` transactions and contributor recognition events are logged to the Akashic Record for complete auditability, as defined in the respective economic protocols.
-   **Governance**: All significant governance actions, such as protocol forks or symbolic resolutions, are committed to the Akashic Record to provide a permanent and immutable history of decisions.

## 4. Underlying Technology (Implementation Note)

While the protocol itself is technology-agnostic, the canonical implementation will leverage a combination of decentralized storage solutions (like IPFS or Arweave) for the data itself and a distributed ledger or verifiable database for indexing and ensuring order and tamper-resistance.
