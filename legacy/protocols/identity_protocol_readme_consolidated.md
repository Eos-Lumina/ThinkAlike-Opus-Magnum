## üß≠ Purpose

The `identity_protocol/` folder defines the philosophical, technical, and social architecture of identity in the ThinkAlike system. It transitions identity from a state-bound, static artifact into a **fluid, forkable, value-aligned construct** embedded within a **post-national digital commons**.

This protocol integrates self-sovereign identity (SSI), verifiable credentials (VCs), decentralized identifiers (DIDs), and resonance-based matching to form the foundation of participation, trust, and civic structure in the ThinkAlike ecosystem.

## üß≠ Purpose

The `identity_protocol/` folder defines the philosophical, technical, and social architecture of identity in the ThinkAlike system. It transitions identity from a state-bound, static artifact into a **fluid, forkable, value-aligned construct** embedded within a **post-national digital commons**.

This protocol integrates self-sovereign identity (SSI), verifiable credentials (VCs), decentralized identifiers (DIDs), and resonance-based matching to form the foundation of participation, trust, and civic structure in the ThinkAlike ecosystem.

## üß≠ Purpose

The `identity_protocol/` folder defines the philosophical, technical, and social architecture of identity in the ThinkAlike system. It transitions identity from a state-bound, static artifact into a **fluid, forkable, value-aligned construct** embedded within a **post-national digital commons**.

This protocol integrates self-sovereign identity (SSI), verifiable credentials (VCs), decentralized identifiers (DIDs), and resonance-based matching to form the foundation of participation, trust, and civic structure in the ThinkAlike ecosystem.

## üß© Role in the Ecosystem

Identity is the anchor point for:

- Matching  
- Collective governance  
- Ethical AI agent personalization  
- Knowledge contribution and credit  
- Community formation and dissolution  
- Liquid democracy and civic engagement  
- Post-national representation

# Identity Protocol Index

**Status:** Maintained
**Maintainer:** Lumina‚à¥ System Meta-Agent
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-17

---

## üß≠ Purpose

The `identity_protocol/` folder defines the philosophical, technical, and social architecture of identity in the ThinkAlike system. It transitions identity from a state-bound, static artifact into a **fluid, forkable, value-aligned construct** embedded within a **post-national digital commons**.

This protocol integrates self-sovereign identity (SSI), verifiable credentials (VCs), decentralized identifiers (DIDs), and resonance-based matching to form the foundation of participation, trust, and civic structure in the ThinkAlike ecosystem.

| `sovereign_stack_protocol.md` | Describes the underlying identity stack (DIDs, VCs, DIDComm, storage, etc.) |
| `post_national_identity_matrix.md` | Framework for post-national citizenship, reputation, and civic multiplicity |
| `identity_protocol_readme.md` | (This file) Index and orientation |
| `value_alignment_matrix.md` (planned) | Matrix of civic values, profiles, and social resonance patterns |
| `identity_curation_guidelines.md` (optional) | Guidelines for creating and maintaining value-aligned identity expressions |
| `identity_governance_layer.md` (planned) | Governance structures for community credential issuance, identity verification, and fork resolution |
