<!--
!!! ATTENTION: MIGRATION IN PROGRESS !!!
This file is a LEGACY ARCHIVE of agent protocols.
All agent roles listed herein are being migrated to individual canonical specification files located in `agents/canonical_specs/`.
The `agent_registry.md` is being updated accordingly.

**DO NOT USE THIS FILE FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT OR AS A PRIMARY REFERENCE FOR AGENT SPECIFICATIONS.**
Refer to `docs/agents/unaligned_agents_migration_todo.md` for migration status.

Once all agents have been fully migrated and their entries in `agent_registry.md` point to their new canonical files, this legacy archive file (`rescued_agent_protocols.md`) will be considered fully deprecated and may be removed from active project documentation if desired, though it can be kept as a historical artifact.

<!-- Original content follows -->
<!--
!!! LEGACY/UNALIGNED AGENT PROTOCOLS !!!
This file contains agent protocols with names and roles NOT ALIGNED with the ThinkAlike project's symbolic and canonical naming conventions.

> **Harmonization Notice (2025-06-11):**
> All canonical agent protocols and symbolic names are maintained in `agent_registry.md` and related canonical specs. The protocols below are preserved ONLY as a legacy/archive reference. Do NOT use these agent names, roles, or domains in any new documentation, code, or onboarding. For all project work, refer to the canonical registry and specs.

# LEGACY/UNALIGNED AGENT PROTOCOLS (ARCHIVE)

> **Note for non-developers and new contributors:**
> This file is a legacy archive of agent protocols. For the current, canonical agent list and specs, see [agent_registry.md](../../canonical_specs/agent_registry.md) and the [Quickstart for Non-Developers](../../../../QUICKSTART_FOR_NONDEVELOPERS.md). Most users do not need to reference or edit this file.

> **IMPORTANT:** The following protocols are NOT project-aligned. Each is marked as legacy/unclassified. For all current and future work, use only the symbolic, project-aligned agent names and roles as found in `agent_registry.md`.
