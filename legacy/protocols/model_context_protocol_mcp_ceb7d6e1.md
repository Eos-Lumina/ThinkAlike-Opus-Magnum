# 🧠 Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## 🧭 Purpose

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) establishes a universal, transparent, and ethically auditable context management system for all AI agents, modules, and user-facing features in ThinkAlike. MCP ensures:

- Consistent context propagation across modules and agents
- Traceable, reversible, and explainable context state changes
- Alignment with the Clarity Protocol and project-wide ethical standards
- Seamless integration with narrative onboarding, resonance matching, and governance flows

---

## 🧩 Scope & Integration

- **Applies to:** All modules (01–09), AI agents (ResonanceAgent, ClarityAgent, etc.), and user/system interactions
- **Context Types:** User profile, narrative state, value vectors, match graphs, community state, transaction context, governance context
- **Integration Points:**
  - Module 1: Identity Onboarding (context capture)
  - Module 2: Resonance Network (context propagation)
  - Module 3: Community Hive (context sharing)
  - Module 8: Governance (context audit, dispute resolution)
- **Cross-links:** [[../context/context_manifest|context_manifest.md]], [[../context/global_map|global_map.md]], [[../context/feature_document_matrix|feature_document_matrix.md]]

## 🧬 Core Principles

| Principle         | Description                                                      |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Transparency** | All context changes are logged and user-visible                  |
| **Consent**      | No context is shared or used without explicit user opt-in         |
| **Reversibility**| All context state changes are reversible within 24h (where legal)|
| **Auditability** | All context flows are traceable and explainable                  |
| **Modularity**   | Protocol is extensible for new modules and agent types           |

---

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

- **Context Object:**
  - Canonical JSON structure for all context payloads
  - Includes: `context_id`, `owner_id`, `agent_id`, `timestamp`, `state`, `history`, `consent_status`, `trace_log`
- **Propagation Layer:**
  - Ensures context is passed between modules/agents with integrity
  - Supports both synchronous (API) and asynchronous (event/log) flows
- **Audit Layer:**
  - All context changes are written to a tamper-evident log (see DataTraceability)
  - Supports user and system-initiated audits
- **Privacy Controls:**
  - Context is only accessible to agents/modules with explicit permissions
  - PrivacyAgent enforces PET/MPC policies

## 🧠 Agent Roles & Responsibilities

| Agent           | MCP Role                                                      |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ResonanceAgent  | Propagates and updates context for matching and discovery     |
| ClarityAgent    | Validates ethical compliance of all context flows             |
| PrivacyAgent    | Enforces consent, privacy, and PET/MPC rules                 |
| NavigatorAgent  | Guides context transitions during onboarding and flows        |
| Eos Lumina∴     | Oversees protocol compliance and audit traceability          |

## 🗂️ Data Model (MCP Context Object)

```json
{
  "context_id": "string",
  "owner_id": "string",
  "agent_id": "string",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601 string",
  "state": { /* context-specific state */ },
  "history": [ /* array of previous states */ ],
  "consent_status": "opted-in | opted-out | pending",
  "trace_log": [ /* audit entries */ ]
}
```
