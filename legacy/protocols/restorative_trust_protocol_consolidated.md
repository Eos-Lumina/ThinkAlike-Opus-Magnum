## 1. Introduction
This protocol defines the mechanisms for building restorative trust and resolving disputes within the ThinkAlike ecosystem, supporting ethical, transparent, and community-driven outcomes.

## 2. Trust-Building Mechanisms
- Reputation and trust signals
- Restorative feedback loops
- Community mediation and facilitation

## 3. Dispute Resolution Flows
- Reporting and triage
- Mediation and restorative circles
- Resolution, audit, and follow-up

## 4. Integration Points
- **Governance:** Voting, proposals, sanctions
- **Wallet:** Audit trails, transaction disputes
- **UI/UX:** User reporting, transparency dashboards

## 5. Open Questions / TODOs
- Finalize trust/reputation models
- Specify mediation and resolution workflows
- Document integration with all relevant modules

## 1. Introduction
This protocol defines the mechanisms for building restorative trust and resolving disputes within the ThinkAlike ecosystem, supporting ethical, transparent, and community-driven outcomes.

## 2. Trust-Building Mechanisms
- Reputation and trust signals
- Restorative feedback loops
- Community mediation and facilitation

## 3. Dispute Resolution Flows
- Reporting and triage
- Mediation and restorative circles
- Resolution, audit, and follow-up

## 4. Integration Points
- **Governance:** Voting, proposals, sanctions
- **Wallet:** Audit trails, transaction disputes
- **UI/UX:** User reporting, transparency dashboards

## 5. Open Questions / TODOs
- Finalize trust/reputation models
- Specify mediation and resolution workflows
- Document integration with all relevant modules
