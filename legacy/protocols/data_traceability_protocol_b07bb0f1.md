# 🔍 Data Traceability Protocol — Provenance, Lineage, and Auditability

## Purpose

The Data Traceability Protocol ensures that all data within ThinkAlike—whether user-provided, system-generated, or algorithmically derived—maintains complete lineage, transparency, and user sovereignty. It provides:
- Pathways for tracking data origins and transformations
- Mechanisms for users to understand and control their data
- Ethical boundaries for data collection, storage, and processing
- Systems for data accountability and auditability across all modules

## Core Principles

### 1. Origin Transparency
- All data must maintain clear records of its source (user, agent, system, or external input).
- Data origin is captured at collection and persists through all transformations.

### 2. Transformation Traceability
- Every transformation, inference, or aggregation is logged with timestamp, method, and responsible agent.
- No “black box” operations: all steps are visible and reviewable.

### 3. Consent Anchoring
- Every trait, value, or profile insight must be linked to a user consent event.
- Consent is reversible, inspectable, and auditable.

### 4. Immutable Audit Trails
- All data operations generate audit logs, which are immutable and cryptographically signed.
- Users and auditors can review the full lineage of any data point.

### 5. Visual Lineage & User Agency
- UI components (e.g., DataTraceability.jsx) provide interactive visualizations of data flows, transformations, and provenance.
- Users can inspect, revoke, or annotate any data lineage entry.

## Implementation Requirements

- Lineage metadata must be securely stored and encrypted.
- All modules must maintain and expose lineage for their data.
- Lineage queries must be performant and accessible to users and auditors.
- Regular validation scans and alerts for lineage breaks or unauthorized access.

## Example: Origin Path Ledger

Each entry contains:
| Field         | Description                                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| trait_key    | Unique identifier for value, skill, emotion, etc.                |
| source       | Source type (e.g., narrative decision, skill import, etc.)       |
| timestamp    | Date of origin + context of capture                              |
| context_link | Link to the file/component where this insight was formed         |
| consent_flag | True/False (explicit user approval for this trait’s usage)       |

## Integration Points
- Eos Lumina Narrative Engine (traceability moments in user choices)
- Resonance Agent Matching Logic (trace markers for all matches)
- Verification System (ethical lineage checks)
- DataTraceability.jsx (UI visualization)

## Visual Identity
- **Sigil:** Spiral shell fused with a data tree
- **Color Palette:** Rusted gold + midnight blue
- **Shape:** Tree with binary leaves spinning inward

## Mythic Blurb
> “Every step leaves a light behind. Trace remembers them all.”

## Technical Implementation

### Data Lineage Architecture

- All data operations must maintain lineage metadata; no "black box" transformations permitted.
- Lineage metadata must be encrypted at the same level as primary data and survive caching, queuing, and persistence.
- Each module is responsible for maintaining its portion of the lineage, with validation at module boundaries and automated testing for lineage integrity.
- Centralized lineage repository for unified storage, high-availability, and backup/recovery; decentralized enforcement for module-level responsibility.
- Continuous monitoring for lineage breaks, alerts for unauthorized data usage, and regular validation scans.

### Metadata Schema

**Standard Fields:**
- `data_id`: Unique identifier
- `creation_timestamp`: ISO 8601 format
- `last_accessed`: ISO 8601 format
- `origin_type`: "user_provided", "system_generated", "derived", "external"
- `consent_reference`: Link to specific consent record
- `purpose_codes`: Array of authorized use purposes
- `access_log`: Recent access history
- `transformation_chain`: References to related data elements
- `security_classification`: Privacy sensitivity level
- `verification_status`: Data quality information

**Type-Specific Fields:**
- Additional fields based on data category (see legacy protocols for details)

### Traceability API

Endpoints for tracking data lineage:

```
GET /api/v1/data/trace/{data_id}
GET /api/v1/data/purpose/{data_id}
GET /api/v1/data/access_history/{data_id}
POST /api/v1/data/update_permissions/{data_id}
```

Responses include metadata, lineage visualization, and control options based on user permissions.

## Ethical Guidelines

1. **No Invisible Data:** The system must not collect, process, or derive data without transparent disclosure to users.
2. **No Orphaned Data:** All data must maintain its full lineage; orphaned or untraceable data must be flagged for review and potential deletion.
3. **No Purpose Creep:** Data collected for one purpose must not be repurposed without explicit user permission and clear explanation.
4. **No Equality of Access ≠ Equality of Control:** Different stakeholders may have different access rights, but control ultimately remains with the user who generated or provided the data.
5. **No Permanent Surrender:** Even when users grant permissions, these are always revocable—no data agreement is irrevocable.

## User Interface: DataTraceability.jsx

The DataTraceability component provides interactive, visual representation of data flows, algorithmic processes, and value influences. See [DataTraceability Component Documentation](../../archive_legacy/legacy_docs/2/project_root_archive_A_docs_ui/datatraceability_documentation.md) for details on features, integration, and usage.
