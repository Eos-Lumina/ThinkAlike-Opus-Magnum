# AI Risk Mitigation Protocol (Canonical, Harmonized)

**Status:** Canonical, harmonized, PET/Clarity-aligned, symbolic/ritual, and accessibility (WCAG AAA) compliant
**Supersedes:** All legacy ai_risk_mitigation_framework.md files

---

## Purpose & Symbolic Framing

This protocol is a living ritual for the ongoing identification, assessment, and mitigation of risks in AI systems within ThinkAlike. It is designed to:
- Embody the principles of the Alchemical Interface Initiative and "Ritual over Interface"
- Ensure PET/Clarity, user empowerment, and mythopoetic engagement
- Support robust accessibility (WCAG AAA) and symbolic user journeys

## Core Risk Categories (Symbolic Lenses)

1. **Bias & Fairness (The Mirror):** Risks of perpetuating or amplifying bias; ritual audits, diverse datasets, and fairness metrics as the mirror for self-reflection.
2. **Transparency (The Lantern):** Opaque decision-making; explainable AI (XAI) and UI-driven validation as the lantern illuminating the path.
3. **Privacy (The Veil):** Unauthorized data access/misuse; data minimization, encryption, and consent as the sacred veil.
4. **Security (The Ward):** Adversarial attacks/data breaches; adversarial testing, rate limiting, and secure APIs as the warding circle.
5. **User Agency (The Key):** Diminished user control; clear UI controls and override mechanisms as the key to empowerment.

## Ritualized Mitigation Strategies

- **Bias Mitigation:** Conduct regular ritual audits, use diverse training data, and apply fairness metrics.
- **Transparency Enhancements:** Employ XAI, provide symbolic UI feedback, and maintain a transparent AI log.
- **Privacy Safeguards:** Enforce data minimization, encryption, and consent-driven workflows.
- **Security Measures:** Perform adversarial testing, implement rate limiting, and design secure APIs.
- **User Empowerment:** Offer clear, accessible UI controls for overriding AI decisions and managing data.

## Integration & Continuous Ritual

- **Verification System:** Symbolically tracks/logs risk assessments and mitigation actions.
- **UI Components:** Visibly display risk mitigation measures and empower user agency.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Update protocol based on user feedback, new risks, and evolving symbolic/ritual needs.

## PET/Clarity & Accessibility Alignment

- All mitigation steps are documented, transparent, and accessible (WCAG AAA)
- Symbolic/ritual language is used to foster mythopoetic engagement and user empowerment
- Protocol is reviewed regularly for PET/Clarity, accessibility, and symbolic resonance

**Harmonization Note:**
This protocol unifies and supersedes all previous ai_risk_mitigation_framework.md files. It is referenced in all indices, mapping tables, and the glossary. All legacy/duplicate files should be deleted after migration.
