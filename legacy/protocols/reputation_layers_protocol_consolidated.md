## Reputation Layers Protocol: Multi-Dimensional Trust in Decentralized Social Systems

In a post-centralized digital ecosystem like ThinkAlike, reputation must evolve beyond simplistic scoring systems or opaque influence algorithms. It must become a **multi-dimensional, contextual, and user-sovereign construct**, reflecting a spectrum of verified contributions, ethical behaviors, and community-specific values. The Reputation Layers Protocol defines the architecture through which reputation is composed, stored, verified, and interpreted within the ThinkAlike identity framework.

---

## I. Design Goals

- **Context-Awareness:** Reputation must be specific to activity domains (governance, collaboration, dispute resolution, etc.).
- **Verifiability:** All reputation data should be cryptographically attestable and transparently auditable.
- **Portability:** Reputation is not locked to a single server or interface. Users carry it across communities.
- **User Sovereignty:** Users retain full control of their reputation keys and verifiable credentials.
- **Plural Valuation:** Communities define their own weighting and recognition schemas.

---

## II. Layered Reputation Model

### 1. **Layer 0 – Genesis Credentials**

- Base verifications (e.g., identity existence, DID anchoring).
- Issued at account creation or by external attestors.
- Non-weighted but required to enter certain modules.

### 2. **Layer 1 – Participation Footprint**

- Frequency, consistency, and longevity of presence across modules.
- Includes contribution to discussions, participatory voting, event attendance.
- Weighted by module entropy and participation depth.

### 3. **Layer 2 – Contribution Quality Signals**

- Peer-reviewed deliverables (code, design, writing, mediation).
- Cross-verified by community raters and AI scoring assistants.
- Reputation modularity ensures fair recognition across skill types.

### 4. **Layer 3 – Ethical Conduct History**

- Mediation logs, endorsement withdrawals, verified conflict resolutions.
- Reflections of behavioral integrity and civic alignment.
- Accessible but privacy-preserving (uses blinded hashes where necessary).

### 5. **Layer 4 – Impact Endorsements**

- Endorsements tied to long-term outcomes or positive social impact.
- Can only be issued by reputation-holding members with deep trust lineage.
- Periodically reviewed for recertification or decay.

---

## III. Technical Architecture

- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs):** Each layer represented by signed VCs anchored to the user’s decentralized identifier (DID).
- **Local Reputation Graphs:** Communities maintain local views of reputation mappings tailored to their own norms and practices.
- **Reputation Oracles:** Optional AI agents that aid in calculating weighted trust metrics based on open formulas and public data.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** Enable reputation verification without revealing underlying behavior details where needed.

---

## IV. Governance and Community Control

- Communities control:
  - Which layers are recognized.
  - How layers are weighted in their local context.
  - When and how reputations decay or are disqualified.
- Forkable protocols: Dissident communities can inherit reputation structure while redefining valuation.

---

## V. Use Cases in ThinkAlike

- **Governance:** Weighted voting rights in liquid/direct democracy modules.
- **Matching:** Deeper resonance scoring based on trust-compatible interactions.
- **Moderation:** Empowering trusted members with dispute resolution tools.
- **Economics:** Access to community resource pools or proposal funding thresholds.

---

## VI. Ethical Safeguards

- **Reputation ≠ Worth:** No use of aggregate scores to rank human value.
- **Appeal Mechanisms:** Users can challenge, retract, or mask unjust endorsements.
- **Consent First:** No user may be publicly ranked without voluntary participation.

---

## Conclusion

The Reputation Layers Protocol embodies a pluralistic, dynamic, and democratic vision of trust-building within decentralized networks. It protects the individual’s narrative while enabling communities to recognize meaningful contributions in ways that reflect their evolving values. This architecture is key to maintaining the integrity of post-national identity and participatory governance within the ThinkAlike paradigm.

## Reputation Layers Protocol: Multi-Dimensional Trust in Decentralized Social Systems

In a post-centralized digital ecosystem like ThinkAlike, reputation must evolve beyond simplistic scoring systems or opaque influence algorithms. It must become a **multi-dimensional, contextual, and user-sovereign construct**, reflecting a spectrum of verified contributions, ethical behaviors, and community-specific values. The Reputation Layers Protocol defines the architecture through which reputation is composed, stored, verified, and interpreted within the ThinkAlike identity framework.

---

## I. Design Goals

- **Context-Awareness:** Reputation must be specific to activity domains (governance, collaboration, dispute resolution, etc.).
- **Verifiability:** All reputation data should be cryptographically attestable and transparently auditable.
- **Portability:** Reputation is not locked to a single server or interface. Users carry it across communities.
- **User Sovereignty:** Users retain full control of their reputation keys and verifiable credentials.
- **Plural Valuation:** Communities define their own weighting and recognition schemas.

---

## II. Layered Reputation Model

### 1. **Layer 0 – Genesis Credentials**

- Base verifications (e.g., identity existence, DID anchoring).
- Issued at account creation or by external attestors.
- Non-weighted but required to enter certain modules.

### 2. **Layer 1 – Participation Footprint**

- Frequency, consistency, and longevity of presence across modules.
- Includes contribution to discussions, participatory voting, event attendance.
- Weighted by module entropy and participation depth.

### 3. **Layer 2 – Contribution Quality Signals**

- Peer-reviewed deliverables (code, design, writing, mediation).
- Cross-verified by community raters and AI scoring assistants.
- Reputation modularity ensures fair recognition across skill types.

### 4. **Layer 3 – Ethical Conduct History**

- Mediation logs, endorsement withdrawals, verified conflict resolutions.
- Reflections of behavioral integrity and civic alignment.
- Accessible but privacy-preserving (uses blinded hashes where necessary).

### 5. **Layer 4 – Impact Endorsements**

- Endorsements tied to long-term outcomes or positive social impact.
- Can only be issued by reputation-holding members with deep trust lineage.
- Periodically reviewed for recertification or decay.

---

## III. Technical Architecture

- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs):** Each layer represented by signed VCs anchored to the user’s decentralized identifier (DID).
- **Local Reputation Graphs:** Communities maintain local views of reputation mappings tailored to their own norms and practices.
- **Reputation Oracles:** Optional AI agents that aid in calculating weighted trust metrics based on open formulas and public data.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** Enable reputation verification without revealing underlying behavior details where needed.

---

## IV. Governance and Community Control

- Communities control:
  - Which layers are recognized.
  - How layers are weighted in their local context.
  - When and how reputations decay or are disqualified.
- Forkable protocols: Dissident communities can inherit reputation structure while redefining valuation.

---

## V. Use Cases in ThinkAlike

- **Governance:** Weighted voting rights in liquid/direct democracy modules.
- **Matching:** Deeper resonance scoring based on trust-compatible interactions.
- **Moderation:** Empowering trusted members with dispute resolution tools.
- **Economics:** Access to community resource pools or proposal funding thresholds.

---

## VI. Ethical Safeguards

- **Reputation ≠ Worth:** No use of aggregate scores to rank human value.
- **Appeal Mechanisms:** Users can challenge, retract, or mask unjust endorsements.

## Reputation Layers Protocol: Multi-Dimensional Trust in Decentralized Social Systems

In a post-centralized digital ecosystem like ThinkAlike, reputation must evolve beyond simplistic scoring systems or opaque influence algorithms. It must become a **multi-dimensional, contextual, and user-sovereign construct**, reflecting a spectrum of verified contributions, ethical behaviors, and community-specific values. The Reputation Layers Protocol defines the architecture through which reputation is composed, stored, verified, and interpreted within the ThinkAlike identity framework.

---

## I. Design Goals

- **Context-Awareness:** Reputation must be specific to activity domains (governance, collaboration, dispute resolution, etc.).
- **Verifiability:** All reputation data should be cryptographically attestable and transparently auditable.
- **Portability:** Reputation is not locked to a single server or interface. Users carry it across communities.
- **User Sovereignty:** Users retain full control of their reputation keys and verifiable credentials.
- **Plural Valuation:** Communities define their own weighting and recognition schemas.

---

## II. Layered Reputation Model

### 1. **Layer 0 – Genesis Credentials**

- Base verifications (e.g., identity existence, DID anchoring).
- Issued at account creation or by external attestors.
- Non-weighted but required to enter certain modules.

### 2. **Layer 1 – Participation Footprint**

- Frequency, consistency, and longevity of presence across modules.
- Includes contribution to discussions, participatory voting, event attendance.
- Weighted by module entropy and participation depth.

### 3. **Layer 2 – Contribution Quality Signals**

- Peer-reviewed deliverables (code, design, writing, mediation).
- Cross-verified by community raters and AI scoring assistants.
- Reputation modularity ensures fair recognition across skill types.

### 4. **Layer 3 – Ethical Conduct History**

- Mediation logs, endorsement withdrawals, verified conflict resolutions.
- Reflections of behavioral integrity and civic alignment.
- Accessible but privacy-preserving (uses blinded hashes where necessary).

### 5. **Layer 4 – Impact Endorsements**

- Endorsements tied to long-term outcomes or positive social impact.
- Can only be issued by reputation-holding members with deep trust lineage.
- Periodically reviewed for recertification or decay.

---

## III. Technical Architecture

- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs):** Each layer represented by signed VCs anchored to the user’s decentralized identifier (DID).
- **Local Reputation Graphs:** Communities maintain local views of reputation mappings tailored to their own norms and practices.
- **Reputation Oracles:** Optional AI agents that aid in calculating weighted trust metrics based on open formulas and public data.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** Enable reputation verification without revealing underlying behavior details where needed.

---

## IV. Governance and Community Control

- Communities control:
  - Which layers are recognized.
  - How layers are weighted in their local context.
  - When and how reputations decay or are disqualified.
- Forkable protocols: Dissident communities can inherit reputation structure while redefining valuation.

---

## V. Use Cases in ThinkAlike

- **Governance:** Weighted voting rights in liquid/direct democracy modules.
- **Matching:** Deeper resonance scoring based on trust-compatible interactions.

- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs):** Each layer represented by signed VCs anchored to the user’s decentralized identifier (DID).
- **Local Reputation Graphs:** Communities maintain local views of reputation mappings tailored to their own norms and practices.
- **Reputation Oracles:** Optional AI agents that aid in calculating weighted trust metrics based on open formulas and public data.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** Enable reputation verification without revealing underlying behavior details where needed.

---

## IV. Governance and Community Control

- Communities control:
  - Which layers are recognized.
  - How layers are weighted in their local context.
  - When and how reputations decay or are disqualified.
- Forkable protocols: Dissident communities can inherit reputation structure while redefining valuation.

---

## V. Use Cases in ThinkAlike

- **Governance:** Weighted voting rights in liquid/direct democracy modules.
- **Matching:** Deeper resonance scoring based on trust-compatible interactions.
- **Moderation:** Empowering trusted members with dispute resolution tools.
- **Economics:** Access to community resource pools or proposal funding thresholds.

---

## VI. Ethical Safeguards

- **Reputation ≠ Worth:** No use of aggregate scores to rank human value.
- **Appeal Mechanisms:** Users can challenge, retract, or mask unjust endorsements.
- **Consent First:** No user may be publicly ranked without voluntary participation.

## Conclusion

The Reputation Layers Protocol embodies a pluralistic, dynamic, and democratic vision of trust-building within decentralized networks. It protects the individual’s narrative while enabling communities to recognize meaningful contributions in ways that reflect their evolving values. This architecture is key to maintaining the integrity of post-national identity and participatory governance within the ThinkAlike paradigm.

## Reputation Layers Protocol: Multi-Dimensional Trust in Decentralized Social Systems

In a post-centralized digital ecosystem like ThinkAlike, reputation must evolve beyond simplistic scoring systems or opaque influence algorithms. It must become a **multi-dimensional, contextual, and user-sovereign construct**, reflecting a spectrum of verified contributions, ethical behaviors, and community-specific values. The Reputation Layers Protocol defines the architecture through which reputation is composed, stored, verified, and interpreted within the ThinkAlike identity framework.

---

## I. Design Goals

- **Context-Awareness:** Reputation must be specific to activity domains (governance, collaboration, dispute resolution, etc.).
- **Verifiability:** All reputation data should be cryptographically attestable and transparently auditable.
- **Portability:** Reputation is not locked to a single server or interface. Users carry it across communities.
- **User Sovereignty:** Users retain full control of their reputation keys and verifiable credentials.
- **Plural Valuation:** Communities define their own weighting and recognition schemas.

---

## II. Layered Reputation Model

### 1. **Layer 0 – Genesis Credentials**

- Base verifications (e.g., identity existence, DID anchoring).
- Issued at account creation or by external attestors.
- Non-weighted but required to enter certain modules.

### 2. **Layer 1 – Participation Footprint**

- Frequency, consistency, and longevity of presence across modules.
- Includes contribution to discussions, participatory voting, event attendance.
- Weighted by module entropy and participation depth.

### 3. **Layer 2 – Contribution Quality Signals**

- Peer-reviewed deliverables (code, design, writing, mediation).
- Cross-verified by community raters and AI scoring assistants.
- Reputation modularity ensures fair recognition across skill types.

### 4. **Layer 3 – Ethical Conduct History**

- Mediation logs, endorsement withdrawals, verified conflict resolutions.
- Reflections of behavioral integrity and civic alignment.
- Accessible but privacy-preserving (uses blinded hashes where necessary).

### 5. **Layer 4 – Impact Endorsements**

- Endorsements tied to long-term outcomes or positive social impact.
- Can only be issued by reputation-holding members with deep trust lineage.
- Periodically reviewed for recertification or decay.

---

## III. Technical Architecture

### 4. **Layer 3 – Ethical Conduct History**

- Mediation logs, endorsement withdrawals, verified conflict resolutions.
- Reflections of behavioral integrity and civic alignment.
- Accessible but privacy-preserving (uses blinded hashes where necessary).

### 5. **Layer 4 – Impact Endorsements**

- Endorsements tied to long-term outcomes or positive social impact.
- Can only be issued by reputation-holding members with deep trust lineage.
- Periodically reviewed for recertification or decay.

## III. Technical Architecture

- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs):** Each layer represented by signed VCs anchored to the user’s decentralized identifier (DID).
- **Local Reputation Graphs:** Communities maintain local views of reputation mappings tailored to their own norms and practices.
- **Reputation Oracles:** Optional AI agents that aid in calculating weighted trust metrics based on open formulas and public data.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** Enable reputation verification without revealing underlying behavior details where needed.

---

## IV. Governance and Community Control

- Communities control:
  - Which layers are recognized.
  - How layers are weighted in their local context.
  - When and how reputations decay or are disqualified.
- Forkable protocols: Dissident communities can inherit reputation structure while redefining valuation.

---

## V. Use Cases in ThinkAlike

- **Governance:** Weighted voting rights in liquid/direct democracy modules.
- **Matching:** Deeper resonance scoring based on trust-compatible interactions.
- **Moderation:** Empowering trusted members with dispute resolution tools.
- **Economics:** Access to community resource pools or proposal funding thresholds.

---

## VI. Ethical Safeguards

- **Reputation ≠ Worth:** No use of aggregate scores to rank human value.
- **Appeal Mechanisms:** Users can challenge, retract, or mask unjust endorsements.
- **Consent First:** No user may be publicly ranked without voluntary participation.

## Conclusion

The Reputation Layers Protocol embodies a pluralistic, dynamic, and democratic vision of trust-building within decentralized networks. It protects the individual’s narrative while enabling communities to recognize meaningful contributions in ways that reflect their evolving values. This architecture is key to maintaining the integrity of post-national identity and participatory governance within the ThinkAlike paradigm.

## Reputation Layers Protocol: Multi-Dimensional Trust in Decentralized Social Systems

In a post-centralized digital ecosystem like ThinkAlike, reputation must evolve beyond simplistic scoring systems or opaque influence algorithms. It must become a **multi-dimensional, contextual, and user-sovereign construct**, reflecting a spectrum of verified contributions, ethical behaviors, and community-specific values. The Reputation Layers Protocol defines the architecture through which reputation is composed, stored, verified, and interpreted within the ThinkAlike identity framework.

---

## I. Design Goals

- **Context-Awareness:** Reputation must be specific to activity domains (governance, collaboration, dispute resolution, etc.).
- **Verifiability:** All reputation data should be cryptographically attestable and transparently auditable.
- **Portability:** Reputation is not locked to a single server or interface. Users carry it across communities.
- **User Sovereignty:** Users retain full control of their reputation keys and verifiable credentials.
- **Plural Valuation:** Communities define their own weighting and recognition schemas.

---

## II. Layered Reputation Model

### 1. **Layer 0 – Genesis Credentials**

- Base verifications (e.g., identity existence, DID anchoring).
- Issued at account creation or by external attestors.
- Non-weighted but required to enter certain modules.

### 2. **Layer 1 – Participation Footprint**

- Frequency, consistency, and longevity of presence across modules.
- Includes contribution to discussions, participatory voting, event attendance.
- Weighted by module entropy and participation depth.

### 3. **Layer 2 – Contribution Quality Signals**

- Peer-reviewed deliverables (code, design, writing, mediation).
- Cross-verified by community raters and AI scoring assistants.
- Reputation modularity ensures fair recognition across skill types.

### 4. **Layer 3 – Ethical Conduct History**

- Mediation logs, endorsement withdrawals, verified conflict resolutions.
- Reflections of behavioral integrity and civic alignment.
- Accessible but privacy-preserving (uses blinded hashes where necessary).

## Reputation Layers Protocol: Multi-Dimensional Trust in Decentralized Social Systems

In a post-centralized digital ecosystem like ThinkAlike, reputation must evolve beyond simplistic scoring systems or opaque influence algorithms. It must become a **multi-dimensional, contextual, and user-sovereign construct**, reflecting a spectrum of verified contributions, ethical behaviors, and community-specific values. The Reputation Layers Protocol defines the architecture through which reputation is composed, stored, verified, and interpreted within the ThinkAlike identity framework.

---

## I. Design Goals

- **Context-Awareness:** Reputation must be specific to activity domains (governance, collaboration, dispute resolution, etc.).
- **Verifiability:** All reputation data should be cryptographically attestable and transparently auditable.
- **Portability:** Reputation is not locked to a single server or interface. Users carry it across communities.
- **User Sovereignty:** Users retain full control of their reputation keys and verifiable credentials.
- **Plural Valuation:** Communities define their own weighting and recognition schemas.

---

## II. Layered Reputation Model

### 1. **Layer 0 – Genesis Credentials**

- Base verifications (e.g., identity existence, DID anchoring).
- Issued at account creation or by external attestors.
- Non-weighted but required to enter certain modules.

- **Context-Awareness:** Reputation must be specific to activity domains (governance, collaboration, dispute resolution, etc.).
- **Verifiability:** All reputation data should be cryptographically attestable and transparently auditable.
- **Portability:** Reputation is not locked to a single server or interface. Users carry it across communities.
- **User Sovereignty:** Users retain full control of their reputation keys and verifiable credentials.
- **Plural Valuation:** Communities define their own weighting and recognition schemas.

## II. Layered Reputation Model

### 1. **Layer 0 – Genesis Credentials**

- Base verifications (e.g., identity existence, DID anchoring).
- Issued at account creation or by external attestors.
- Non-weighted but required to enter certain modules.

### 2. **Layer 1 – Participation Footprint**

- Frequency, consistency, and longevity of presence across modules.
- Includes contribution to discussions, participatory voting, event attendance.
- Weighted by module entropy and participation depth.

### 3. **Layer 2 – Contribution Quality Signals**

- Peer-reviewed deliverables (code, design, writing, mediation).
- Cross-verified by community raters and AI scoring assistants.
- Reputation modularity ensures fair recognition across skill types.

### 4. **Layer 3 – Ethical Conduct History**

- Mediation logs, endorsement withdrawals, verified conflict resolutions.
- Reflections of behavioral integrity and civic alignment.
- Accessible but privacy-preserving (uses blinded hashes where necessary).

### 5. **Layer 4 – Impact Endorsements**

- Endorsements tied to long-term outcomes or positive social impact.
- Can only be issued by reputation-holding members with deep trust lineage.
- Periodically reviewed for recertification or decay.

## III. Technical Architecture

- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs):** Each layer represented by signed VCs anchored to the user’s decentralized identifier (DID).
- **Local Reputation Graphs:** Communities maintain local views of reputation mappings tailored to their own norms and practices.
- **Reputation Oracles:** Optional AI agents that aid in calculating weighted trust metrics based on open formulas and public data.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** Enable reputation verification without revealing underlying behavior details where needed.

## IV. Governance and Community Control

- Communities control:
  - Which layers are recognized.
  - How layers are weighted in their local context.
  - When and how reputations decay or are disqualified.
- Forkable protocols: Dissident communities can inherit reputation structure while redefining valuation.

## V. Use Cases in ThinkAlike

- **Governance:** Weighted voting rights in liquid/direct democracy modules.
- **Matching:** Deeper resonance scoring based on trust-compatible interactions.
- **Moderation:** Empowering trusted members with dispute resolution tools.
- **Economics:** Access to community resource pools or proposal funding thresholds.

---

## VI. Ethical Safeguards

- **Reputation ≠ Worth:** No use of aggregate scores to rank human value.
- **Appeal Mechanisms:** Users can challenge, retract, or mask unjust endorsements.
- **Consent First:** No user may be publicly ranked without voluntary participation.

## Conclusion

The Reputation Layers Protocol embodies a pluralistic, dynamic, and democratic vision of trust-building within decentralized networks. It protects the individual’s narrative while enabling communities to recognize meaningful contributions in ways that reflect their evolving values. This architecture is key to maintaining the integrity of post-national identity and participatory governance within the ThinkAlike paradigm.
