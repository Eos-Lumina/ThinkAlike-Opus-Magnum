# Contradiction Flagging Protocol

**Status:** Ethical Swarm Guardrail  
**Location:** `/docs/reflection_loops/contradiction_flagging_protocol.md`

## Purpose

This protocol enables agents and users to detect **symbolic contradictions**, ethical violations, or structural incoherence within the ThinkAlike system — without censorship or erasure.

Contradiction is not punished — it is **ritualized** and resolved.

---

## Detection Logic

- Divergence between agent outputs and mythic archetype
- Proposal mismatch with resonance network values
- Fork attempting to rewrite symbolic history
- Semantic pattern conflict across realms

---

## Protocol Flow

1. Detection triggered  
2. Mirror Event generated  
3. Swarm review initiated  
4. Resolution ritual proposed  
5. Alignment restored or fork affirmed
