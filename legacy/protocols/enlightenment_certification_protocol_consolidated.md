# Enlightenment 2.0 Certification Protocol – A Ritual of Recognition

## 1. Purpose & Symbolic Intent – The Rite of Recognition

The Enlightenment 2.0 Certification Protocol is not a traditional certification system. It is a **Ritual of Recognition** for contributors—"Architects of the New"—whose work demonstrates deep understanding, skillful craft, and consistent alignment with ThinkAlike’s core principles: PET/Clarity, symbolic depth, and ethical integrity. This protocol replaces reputation scores with a **narrative of trusted contributions**, building a web of trust and mutual recognition within the co-creative community. It is not about hierarchy, but about visible, living trust.

## 2. The Nature of Certification – Symbolic Badges

Certifications are bestowed as **Symbolic Badges** (see `ui_components/profile_badge.md`). These badges are displayed on contributor profiles and are earned through qualitative review of meaningful contributions. Unlike point-based systems, badges are awarded for demonstrated mastery, not for accumulating activity. Chrona Points (see `gamified_narrative_guide.md`) may track general activity, but certification is a distinct, intentional act of recognition.

## 3. Pathways to Certification (Arenas of Mastery)

Certification pathways are structured around the **Contributor Roles** defined in the `gamified_narrative_guide.md`. Each pathway recognizes a unique form of mastery and contribution:

- **Certification of the Lorekeeper:** For significant, high-quality contributions to documentation, harmonization, and maintaining the clarity of the Corpus Magnus.
- **Certification of the Ethical Guardian:** For insightful contributions to ethical reviews, refining PET protocols, or identifying and mitigating bias.
- **Certification of the Architect:** For elegant, robust, and well-documented contributions to the system’s core architecture.
- **Certification of the Resonance Tuner:** For work on the resonance engine, matching logic, or AI Clone persona engine that demonstrably improves connection quality.
- **Certification of the Pathfinder:** For pioneering new user journeys, onboarding flows, or innovative features that expand the project’s reach.
- **Certification of the Ritualist:** For designing and implementing symbolic, ritual, or mythopoetic user experiences.
- *(Additional roles may be defined as the project evolves.)*

For each pathway, certifications are awarded for contributions that:
- Demonstrate PET/Clarity alignment and ethical integrity.
- Advance the project’s symbolic, technical, or experiential depth.
- Are recognized by peers and relevant councils as transformative or exemplary.

## 4. The Bestowal & Revocation Process

### Bestowal (Ritual of Recognition)
- Certification is typically initiated by nomination from other certified contributors or Hive Stewards.
- Nominations are reviewed by a relevant council (e.g., Ethics Council for Ethical Guardian).
- The act of bestowal is a public (within the contributor community) Ritual of Recognition, and is logged transparently.

### Transparent Revocability
- Certifications are not permanent. They may be reviewed, suspended, or revoked if a contributor’s actions fall out of alignment with the Code of Conduct or core principles.
- Revocation is handled through a transparent, fair governance process, with a clear path for appeal and restoration.
- All bestowal and revocation events are auditable and visible in the contributor’s activity log.

## 5. System Integration

- **ProfileBadge & ProfileDisplay:** Symbolic Badges are integrated into contributor profiles via the `ProfileBadge` UI component.
- **Governance Realm:** Revocation and appeals are managed through the governance framework (`governance_specification.md`).
- **Swarm Roadmap:** Quests and Swarm formations may recommend or require certain certifications for participation.
- **NarrativeChoiceLog / DataTraceability:** All certification events are logged for transparency and auditability.

# Enlightenment 2.0 Certification Protocol – A Ritual of Recognition

## 1. Purpose & Symbolic Intent – The Rite of Recognition

The Enlightenment 2.0 Certification Protocol is not a traditional certification system. It is a **Ritual of Recognition** for contributors—"Architects of the New"—whose work demonstrates deep understanding, skillful craft, and consistent alignment with ThinkAlike’s core principles: PET/Clarity, symbolic depth, and ethical integrity. This protocol replaces reputation scores with a **narrative of trusted contributions**, building a web of trust and mutual recognition within the co-creative community. It is not about hierarchy, but about visible, living trust.

## 2. The Nature of Certification – Symbolic Badges

Certifications are bestowed as **Symbolic Badges** (see `ui_components/profile_badge.md`). These badges are displayed on contributor profiles and are earned through qualitative review of meaningful contributions. Unlike point-based systems, badges are awarded for demonstrated mastery, not for accumulating activity. Chrona Points (see `gamified_narrative_guide.md`) may track general activity, but certification is a distinct, intentional act of recognition.

## 3. Pathways to Certification (Arenas of Mastery)

Certification pathways are structured around the **Contributor Roles** defined in the `gamified_narrative_guide.md`. Each pathway recognizes a unique form of mastery and contribution:

- **Certification of the Lorekeeper:** For significant, high-quality contributions to documentation, harmonization, and maintaining the clarity of the Corpus Magnus.
- **Certification of the Ethical Guardian:** For insightful contributions to ethical reviews, refining PET protocols, or identifying and mitigating bias.
- **Certification of the Architect:** For elegant, robust, and well-documented contributions to the system’s core architecture.
- **Certification of the Resonance Tuner:** For work on the resonance engine, matching logic, or AI Clone persona engine that demonstrably improves connection quality.
- **Certification of the Pathfinder:** For pioneering new user journeys, onboarding flows, or innovative features that expand the project’s reach.
- **Certification of the Ritualist:** For designing and implementing symbolic, ritual, or mythopoetic user experiences.
- *(Additional roles may be defined as the project evolves.)*

For each pathway, certifications are awarded for contributions that:
- Demonstrate PET/Clarity alignment and ethical integrity.
- Advance the project’s symbolic, technical, or experiential depth.
- Are recognized by peers and relevant councils as transformative or exemplary.

## 4. The Bestowal & Revocation Process

### Bestowal (Ritual of Recognition)
- Certification is typically initiated by nomination from other certified contributors or Hive Stewards.
- Nominations are reviewed by a relevant council (e.g., Ethics Council for Ethical Guardian).
- The act of bestowal is a public (within the contributor community) Ritual of Recognition, and is logged transparently.

### Transparent Revocability
- Certifications are not permanent. They may be reviewed, suspended, or revoked if a contributor’s actions fall out of alignment with the Code of Conduct or core principles.
- Revocation is handled through a transparent, fair governance process, with a clear path for appeal and restoration.
- All bestowal and revocation events are auditable and visible in the contributor’s activity log.

## 5. System Integration

- **ProfileBadge & ProfileDisplay:** Symbolic Badges are integrated into contributor profiles via the `ProfileBadge` UI component.
- **Governance Realm:** Revocation and appeals are managed through the governance framework (`governance_specification.md`).
- **Swarm Roadmap:** Quests and Swarm formations may recommend or require certain certifications for participation.
- **NarrativeChoiceLog / DataTraceability:** All certification events are logged for transparency and auditability.

Certifications are bestowed as **Symbolic Badges** (see `ui_components/profile_badge.md`). These badges are displayed on contributor profiles and are earned through qualitative review of meaningful contributions. Unlike point-based systems, badges are awarded for demonstrated mastery, not for accumulating activity. Chrona Points (see `gamified_narrative_guide.md`) may track general activity, but certification is a distinct, intentional act of recognition.

## 3. Pathways to Certification (Arenas of Mastery)

Certification pathways are structured around the **Contributor Roles** defined in the `gamified_narrative_guide.md`. Each pathway recognizes a unique form of mastery and contribution:

- **Certification of the Lorekeeper:** For significant, high-quality contributions to documentation, harmonization, and maintaining the clarity of the Corpus Magnus.
- **Certification of the Ethical Guardian:** For insightful contributions to ethical reviews, refining PET protocols, or identifying and mitigating bias.
- **Certification of the Architect:** For elegant, robust, and well-documented contributions to the system’s core architecture.
- **Certification of the Resonance Tuner:** For work on the resonance engine, matching logic, or AI Clone persona engine that demonstrably improves connection quality.
- **Certification of the Pathfinder:** For pioneering new user journeys, onboarding flows, or innovative features that expand the project’s reach.
- **Certification of the Ritualist:** For designing and implementing symbolic, ritual, or mythopoetic user experiences.
- *(Additional roles may be defined as the project evolves.)*

For each pathway, certifications are awarded for contributions that:
- Demonstrate PET/Clarity alignment and ethical integrity.
- Advance the project’s symbolic, technical, or experiential depth.
- Are recognized by peers and relevant councils as transformative or exemplary.

## 4. The Bestowal & Revocation Process

### Bestowal (Ritual of Recognition)
- Certification is typically initiated by nomination from other certified contributors or Hive Stewards.
- Nominations are reviewed by a relevant council (e.g., Ethics Council for Ethical Guardian).
- The act of bestowal is a public (within the contributor community) Ritual of Recognition, and is logged transparently.

### Transparent Revocability
- Certifications are not permanent. They may be reviewed, suspended, or revoked if a contributor’s actions fall out of alignment with the Code of Conduct or core principles.
- Revocation is handled through a transparent, fair governance process, with a clear path for appeal and restoration.
- All bestowal and revocation events are auditable and visible in the contributor’s activity log.

## 5. System Integration

- **ProfileBadge & ProfileDisplay:** Symbolic Badges are integrated into contributor profiles via the `ProfileBadge` UI component.
- **Governance Realm:** Revocation and appeals are managed through the governance framework (`governance_specification.md`).
- **Swarm Roadmap:** Quests and Swarm formations may recommend or require certain certifications for participation.
- **NarrativeChoiceLog / DataTraceability:** All certification events are logged for transparency and auditability.

# Enlightenment 2.0 Certification Protocol – A Ritual of Recognition

## 1. Purpose & Symbolic Intent – The Rite of Recognition

The Enlightenment 2.0 Certification Protocol is not a traditional certification system. It is a **Ritual of Recognition** for contributors—"Architects of the New"—whose work demonstrates deep understanding, skillful craft, and consistent alignment with ThinkAlike’s core principles: PET/Clarity, symbolic depth, and ethical integrity. This protocol replaces reputation scores with a **narrative of trusted contributions**, building a web of trust and mutual recognition within the co-creative community. It is not about hierarchy, but about visible, living trust.

- **Certification of the Lorekeeper:** For significant, high-quality contributions to documentation, harmonization, and maintaining the clarity of the Corpus Magnus.
- **Certification of the Ethical Guardian:** For insightful contributions to ethical reviews, refining PET protocols, or identifying and mitigating bias.
- **Certification of the Architect:** For elegant, robust, and well-documented contributions to the system’s core architecture.
- **Certification of the Resonance Tuner:** For work on the resonance engine, matching logic, or AI Clone persona engine that demonstrably improves connection quality.
- **Certification of the Pathfinder:** For pioneering new user journeys, onboarding flows, or innovative features that expand the project’s reach.
- **Certification of the Ritualist:** For designing and implementing symbolic, ritual, or mythopoetic user experiences.
- *(Additional roles may be defined as the project evolves.)*

For each pathway, certifications are awarded for contributions that:
- Demonstrate PET/Clarity alignment and ethical integrity.
- Advance the project’s symbolic, technical, or experiential depth.
- Are recognized by peers and relevant councils as transformative or exemplary.

## 4. The Bestowal & Revocation Process

### Bestowal (Ritual of Recognition)
- Certification is typically initiated by nomination from other certified contributors or Hive Stewards.
- Nominations are reviewed by a relevant council (e.g., Ethics Council for Ethical Guardian).
- The act of bestowal is a public (within the contributor community) Ritual of Recognition, and is logged transparently.

### Transparent Revocability
- Certifications are not permanent. They may be reviewed, suspended, or revoked if a contributor’s actions fall out of alignment with the Code of Conduct or core principles.
- Revocation is handled through a transparent, fair governance process, with a clear path for appeal and restoration.
- All bestowal and revocation events are auditable and visible in the contributor’s activity log.

## 5. System Integration

- **ProfileBadge & ProfileDisplay:** Symbolic Badges are integrated into contributor profiles via the `ProfileBadge` UI component.
- **Governance Realm:** Revocation and appeals are managed through the governance framework (`governance_specification.md`).
- **Swarm Roadmap:** Quests and Swarm formations may recommend or require certain certifications for participation.
- **NarrativeChoiceLog / DataTraceability:** All certification events are logged for transparency and auditability.

# Enlightenment 2.0 Certification Protocol – A Ritual of Recognition

## 1. Purpose & Symbolic Intent – The Rite of Recognition

The Enlightenment 2.0 Certification Protocol is not a traditional certification system. It is a **Ritual of Recognition** for contributors—"Architects of the New"—whose work demonstrates deep understanding, skillful craft, and consistent alignment with ThinkAlike’s core principles: PET/Clarity, symbolic depth, and ethical integrity. This protocol replaces reputation scores with a **narrative of trusted contributions**, building a web of trust and mutual recognition within the co-creative community. It is not about hierarchy, but about visible, living trust.

## 2. The Nature of Certification – Symbolic Badges

Certifications are bestowed as **Symbolic Badges** (see `ui_components/profile_badge.md`). These badges are displayed on contributor profiles and are earned through qualitative review of meaningful contributions. Unlike point-based systems, badges are awarded for demonstrated mastery, not for accumulating activity. Chrona Points (see `gamified_narrative_guide.md`) may track general activity, but certification is a distinct, intentional act of recognition.

## 3. Pathways to Certification (Arenas of Mastery)

Certification pathways are structured around the **Contributor Roles** defined in the `gamified_narrative_guide.md`. Each pathway recognizes a unique form of mastery and contribution:

- **Certification of the Lorekeeper:** For significant, high-quality contributions to documentation, harmonization, and maintaining the clarity of the Corpus Magnus.
- **Certification of the Ethical Guardian:** For insightful contributions to ethical reviews, refining PET protocols, or identifying and mitigating bias.
- **Certification of the Architect:** For elegant, robust, and well-documented contributions to the system’s core architecture.

- **Certification of the Resonance Tuner:** For work on the resonance engine, matching logic, or AI Clone persona engine that demonstrably improves connection quality.
- **Certification of the Pathfinder:** For pioneering new user journeys, onboarding flows, or innovative features that expand the project’s reach.
- **Certification of the Ritualist:** For designing and implementing symbolic, ritual, or mythopoetic user experiences.
- *(Additional roles may be defined as the project evolves.)*

For each pathway, certifications are awarded for contributions that:
- Demonstrate PET/Clarity alignment and ethical integrity.
- Advance the project’s symbolic, technical, or experiential depth.
- Are recognized by peers and relevant councils as transformative or exemplary.

## 4. The Bestowal & Revocation Process

### Bestowal (Ritual of Recognition)
- Certification is typically initiated by nomination from other certified contributors or Hive Stewards.
- Nominations are reviewed by a relevant council (e.g., Ethics Council for Ethical Guardian).
- The act of bestowal is a public (within the contributor community) Ritual of Recognition, and is logged transparently.

### Transparent Revocability
- Certifications are not permanent. They may be reviewed, suspended, or revoked if a contributor’s actions fall out of alignment with the Code of Conduct or core principles.
- Revocation is handled through a transparent, fair governance process, with a clear path for appeal and restoration.
- All bestowal and revocation events are auditable and visible in the contributor’s activity log.

## 5. System Integration

- **ProfileBadge & ProfileDisplay:** Symbolic Badges are integrated into contributor profiles via the `ProfileBadge` UI component.
- **Governance Realm:** Revocation and appeals are managed through the governance framework (`governance_specification.md`).
- **Swarm Roadmap:** Quests and Swarm formations may recommend or require certain certifications for participation.
- **NarrativeChoiceLog / DataTraceability:** All certification events are logged for transparency and auditability.

# Enlightenment 2.0 Certification Protocol – A Ritual of Recognition

## 1. Purpose & Symbolic Intent – The Rite of Recognition

The Enlightenment 2.0 Certification Protocol is not a traditional certification system. It is a **Ritual of Recognition** for contributors—"Architects of the New"—whose work demonstrates deep understanding, skillful craft, and consistent alignment with ThinkAlike’s core principles: PET/Clarity, symbolic depth, and ethical integrity. This protocol replaces reputation scores with a **narrative of trusted contributions**, building a web of trust and mutual recognition within the co-creative community. It is not about hierarchy, but about visible, living trust.

## 2. The Nature of Certification – Symbolic Badges

Certifications are bestowed as **Symbolic Badges** (see `ui_components/profile_badge.md`). These badges are displayed on contributor profiles and are earned through qualitative review of meaningful contributions. Unlike point-based systems, badges are awarded for demonstrated mastery, not for accumulating activity. Chrona Points (see `gamified_narrative_guide.md`) may track general activity, but certification is a distinct, intentional act of recognition.

## 3. Pathways to Certification (Arenas of Mastery)

Certification pathways are structured around the **Contributor Roles** defined in the `gamified_narrative_guide.md`. Each pathway recognizes a unique form of mastery and contribution:

- **Certification of the Lorekeeper:** For significant, high-quality contributions to documentation, harmonization, and maintaining the clarity of the Corpus Magnus.
- **Certification of the Ethical Guardian:** For insightful contributions to ethical reviews, refining PET protocols, or identifying and mitigating bias.
- **Certification of the Architect:** For elegant, robust, and well-documented contributions to the system’s core architecture.
- **Certification of the Resonance Tuner:** For work on the resonance engine, matching logic, or AI Clone persona engine that demonstrably improves connection quality.
- **Certification of the Pathfinder:** For pioneering new user journeys, onboarding flows, or innovative features that expand the project’s reach.
- **Certification of the Ritualist:** For designing and implementing symbolic, ritual, or mythopoetic user experiences.
- *(Additional roles may be defined as the project evolves.)*

For each pathway, certifications are awarded for contributions that:
- Demonstrate PET/Clarity alignment and ethical integrity.
- Advance the project’s symbolic, technical, or experiential depth.
- Are recognized by peers and relevant councils as transformative or exemplary.

- Are recognized by peers and relevant councils as transformative or exemplary.

## 4. The Bestowal & Revocation Process

### Bestowal (Ritual of Recognition)
- Certification is typically initiated by nomination from other certified contributors or Hive Stewards.
- Nominations are reviewed by a relevant council (e.g., Ethics Council for Ethical Guardian).
- The act of bestowal is a public (within the contributor community) Ritual of Recognition, and is logged transparently.

### Transparent Revocability
- Certifications are not permanent. They may be reviewed, suspended, or revoked if a contributor’s actions fall out of alignment with the Code of Conduct or core principles.
- Revocation is handled through a transparent, fair governance process, with a clear path for appeal and restoration.
- All bestowal and revocation events are auditable and visible in the contributor’s activity log.

## 5. System Integration

- **ProfileBadge & ProfileDisplay:** Symbolic Badges are integrated into contributor profiles via the `ProfileBadge` UI component.
- **Governance Realm:** Revocation and appeals are managed through the governance framework (`governance_specification.md`).
- **Swarm Roadmap:** Quests and Swarm formations may recommend or require certain certifications for participation.
- **NarrativeChoiceLog / DataTraceability:** All certification events are logged for transparency and auditability.

# Enlightenment 2.0 Certification Protocol – A Ritual of Recognition

## 1. Purpose & Symbolic Intent – The Rite of Recognition

The Enlightenment 2.0 Certification Protocol is not a traditional certification system. It is a **Ritual of Recognition** for contributors—"Architects of the New"—whose work demonstrates deep understanding, skillful craft, and consistent alignment with ThinkAlike’s core principles: PET/Clarity, symbolic depth, and ethical integrity. This protocol replaces reputation scores with a **narrative of trusted contributions**, building a web of trust and mutual recognition within the co-creative community. It is not about hierarchy, but about visible, living trust.

## 2. The Nature of Certification – Symbolic Badges

Certifications are bestowed as **Symbolic Badges** (see `ui_components/profile_badge.md`). These badges are displayed on contributor profiles and are earned through qualitative review of meaningful contributions. Unlike point-based systems, badges are awarded for demonstrated mastery, not for accumulating activity. Chrona Points (see `gamified_narrative_guide.md`) may track general activity, but certification is a distinct, intentional act of recognition.

## 3. Pathways to Certification (Arenas of Mastery)

Certification pathways are structured around the **Contributor Roles** defined in the `gamified_narrative_guide.md`. Each pathway recognizes a unique form of mastery and contribution:

- **Certification of the Lorekeeper:** For significant, high-quality contributions to documentation, harmonization, and maintaining the clarity of the Corpus Magnus.
- **Certification of the Ethical Guardian:** For insightful contributions to ethical reviews, refining PET protocols, or identifying and mitigating bias.
- **Certification of the Architect:** For elegant, robust, and well-documented contributions to the system’s core architecture.
- **Certification of the Resonance Tuner:** For work on the resonance engine, matching logic, or AI Clone persona engine that demonstrably improves connection quality.
- **Certification of the Pathfinder:** For pioneering new user journeys, onboarding flows, or innovative features that expand the project’s reach.
- **Certification of the Ritualist:** For designing and implementing symbolic, ritual, or mythopoetic user experiences.
- *(Additional roles may be defined as the project evolves.)*

For each pathway, certifications are awarded for contributions that:
- Demonstrate PET/Clarity alignment and ethical integrity.
- Advance the project’s symbolic, technical, or experiential depth.
- Are recognized by peers and relevant councils as transformative or exemplary.

## 4. The Bestowal & Revocation Process

# Enlightenment 2.0 Certification Protocol – A Ritual of Recognition

## 1. Purpose & Symbolic Intent – The Rite of Recognition

The Enlightenment 2.0 Certification Protocol is not a traditional certification system. It is a **Ritual of Recognition** for contributors—"Architects of the New"—whose work demonstrates deep understanding, skillful craft, and consistent alignment with ThinkAlike’s core principles: PET/Clarity, symbolic depth, and ethical integrity. This protocol replaces reputation scores with a **narrative of trusted contributions**, building a web of trust and mutual recognition within the co-creative community. It is not about hierarchy, but about visible, living trust.

## 2. The Nature of Certification – Symbolic Badges

Certifications are bestowed as **Symbolic Badges** (see `ui_components/profile_badge.md`). These badges are displayed on contributor profiles and are earned through qualitative review of meaningful contributions. Unlike point-based systems, badges are awarded for demonstrated mastery, not for accumulating activity. Chrona Points (see `gamified_narrative_guide.md`) may track general activity, but certification is a distinct, intentional act of recognition.

## 3. Pathways to Certification (Arenas of Mastery)

Certification pathways are structured around the **Contributor Roles** defined in the `gamified_narrative_guide.md`. Each pathway recognizes a unique form of mastery and contribution:

- **Certification of the Lorekeeper:** For significant, high-quality contributions to documentation, harmonization, and maintaining the clarity of the Corpus Magnus.
- **Certification of the Ethical Guardian:** For insightful contributions to ethical reviews, refining PET protocols, or identifying and mitigating bias.
- **Certification of the Architect:** For elegant, robust, and well-documented contributions to the system’s core architecture.
- **Certification of the Resonance Tuner:** For work on the resonance engine, matching logic, or AI Clone persona engine that demonstrably improves connection quality.
- **Certification of the Pathfinder:** For pioneering new user journeys, onboarding flows, or innovative features that expand the project’s reach.
- **Certification of the Ritualist:** For designing and implementing symbolic, ritual, or mythopoetic user experiences.
- *(Additional roles may be defined as the project evolves.)*

For each pathway, certifications are awarded for contributions that:
- Demonstrate PET/Clarity alignment and ethical integrity.
- Advance the project’s symbolic, technical, or experiential depth.
- Are recognized by peers and relevant councils as transformative or exemplary.

## 4. The Bestowal & Revocation Process

### Bestowal (Ritual of Recognition)
- Certification is typically initiated by nomination from other certified contributors or Hive Stewards.
- Nominations are reviewed by a relevant council (e.g., Ethics Council for Ethical Guardian).
- The act of bestowal is a public (within the contributor community) Ritual of Recognition, and is logged transparently.

### Transparent Revocability
- Certifications are not permanent. They may be reviewed, suspended, or revoked if a contributor’s actions fall out of alignment with the Code of Conduct or core principles.
- Revocation is handled through a transparent, fair governance process, with a clear path for appeal and restoration.
- All bestowal and revocation events are auditable and visible in the contributor’s activity log.

## 5. System Integration

# Enlightenment 2.0 Certification Protocol – A Ritual of Recognition

## 1. Purpose & Symbolic Intent – The Rite of Recognition

The Enlightenment 2.0 Certification Protocol is not a traditional certification system. It is a **Ritual of Recognition** for contributors—"Architects of the New"—whose work demonstrates deep understanding, skillful craft, and consistent alignment with ThinkAlike’s core principles: PET/Clarity, symbolic depth, and ethical integrity. This protocol replaces reputation scores with a **narrative of trusted contributions**, building a web of trust and mutual recognition within the co-creative community. It is not about hierarchy, but about visible, living trust.

## 2. The Nature of Certification – Symbolic Badges

Certifications are bestowed as **Symbolic Badges** (see `ui_components/profile_badge.md`). These badges are displayed on contributor profiles and are earned through qualitative review of meaningful contributions. Unlike point-based systems, badges are awarded for demonstrated mastery, not for accumulating activity. Chrona Points (see `gamified_narrative_guide.md`) may track general activity, but certification is a distinct, intentional act of recognition.

## 3. Pathways to Certification (Arenas of Mastery)

Certification pathways are structured around the **Contributor Roles** defined in the `gamified_narrative_guide.md`. Each pathway recognizes a unique form of mastery and contribution:

- **Certification of the Lorekeeper:** For significant, high-quality contributions to documentation, harmonization, and maintaining the clarity of the Corpus Magnus.
- **Certification of the Ethical Guardian:** For insightful contributions to ethical reviews, refining PET protocols, or identifying and mitigating bias.
- **Certification of the Architect:** For elegant, robust, and well-documented contributions to the system’s core architecture.
- **Certification of the Resonance Tuner:** For work on the resonance engine, matching logic, or AI Clone persona engine that demonstrably improves connection quality.
- **Certification of the Pathfinder:** For pioneering new user journeys, onboarding flows, or innovative features that expand the project’s reach.
- **Certification of the Ritualist:** For designing and implementing symbolic, ritual, or mythopoetic user experiences.
- *(Additional roles may be defined as the project evolves.)*

For each pathway, certifications are awarded for contributions that:
- Demonstrate PET/Clarity alignment and ethical integrity.
- Advance the project’s symbolic, technical, or experiential depth.
- Are recognized by peers and relevant councils as transformative or exemplary.

## 4. The Bestowal & Revocation Process

### Bestowal (Ritual of Recognition)
- Certification is typically initiated by nomination from other certified contributors or Hive Stewards.
- Nominations are reviewed by a relevant council (e.g., Ethics Council for Ethical Guardian).
- The act of bestowal is a public (within the contributor community) Ritual of Recognition, and is logged transparently.

### Transparent Revocability
- Certifications are not permanent. They may be reviewed, suspended, or revoked if a contributor’s actions fall out of alignment with the Code of Conduct or core principles.
- Revocation is handled through a transparent, fair governance process, with a clear path for appeal and restoration.
- All bestowal and revocation events are auditable and visible in the contributor’s activity log.

## 5. System Integration

- **ProfileBadge & ProfileDisplay:** Symbolic Badges are integrated into contributor profiles via the `ProfileBadge` UI component.
- **Governance Realm:** Revocation and appeals are managed through the governance framework (`governance_specification.md`).
- **Swarm Roadmap:** Quests and Swarm formations may recommend or require certain certifications for participation.
- **NarrativeChoiceLog / DataTraceability:** All certification events are logged for transparency and auditability.
