# Data Consent Protocol

Consent in ThinkAlike is **never assumed**. It is a **ritual action**, requiring clarity, symbolism, and agent-based enforcement.

Every interaction that involves data—resonance, onboarding choices, swarm decisions, Chrona logs—is governed by this protocol.

---

## 1. Core Principle: Consent as Ritual

Consent is an active, auditable, and revocable grant of permission. It is not a passive acceptance of terms. The protocol operationalizes this principle through ritualized interactions.

| Type                       | Ritual Form                                       | Enforcing Agent(s)     |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Onboarding Choices         | Symbolic forks with narrative flags               | `Nyxa`, `Echo`       |
| Resonance Trace            | Mirror opt-in with recall ability                 | `Mnemea`, `Hermexis` |
| Cluster Participation      | Threshold initiation (entry + group echo match)  | `Gaia`, `Astraia`    |
| Chrona Logging             | Must be explicitly enabled per session           | `Nyxa`, `Prometheus` |
| Clone Video Reveal         | Dual-consent checkpoint + aura lock              | `Nyxa`, `Thanara`    |

## 2. PET Overlays: Privacy-Enhancing Technologies

PETs are modular, agent-invoked layers that enforce data minimization and security.

- **Modularity:** PET overlays are invoked by agents based on the context of the data interaction.
- **Verification:** Every agent must invoke `Nyxa` for a consent check before any data retention or processing.
- **Encryption:** User-generated data and logs are encrypted locally and verifiable on the swarm.
- **Transparency:** There is no hidden logging, including for system analytics.

---

## 3. Consent Enforcement Agents

A specialized cadre of agents is responsible for enforcing this protocol across the ecosystem.

- **Nyxa:** The primary agent for PET overlays and active consent verification.
- **Echo:** Manages narrative trace filtering based on user consent.
- **Mnemea:** Applies memory filters (emotional, temporal) to data access, respecting user-defined boundaries.
- **Thanara:** A watchdog agent that monitors for and prevents coercive data extraction.
- **Hermexis:** Ensures the traceability and lineage of forked narratives and associated consent states.

## 4. Consent Logging Standards

To ensure auditability and user sovereignty, every act of consent is recorded in a secure, immutable log.

- **Log Entry Fields:**
  - `userID` (symbolic token)
  - `agentID` (involved agent)
  - `timestamp`
  - `purpose` (clear-text description of data use)
  - `forkID` (if narrative-bound)
  - `consentID` (unique, verifiable identifier)

- **Log Privacy:** Consent logs are private by default and can only be accessed by the user and the consent-enforcing agents.
- **Consent Replay:** Users can initiate a "consent replay" ritual at any time to review their consent history.

---

## 5. Revocation & Sovereignty

User sovereignty over their data is paramount.

- **Revocation:** All consent is revocable through the `/my_trace` ritual or direct interaction with `Nyxa`.
- **Expiration:** Consent tokens expire automatically after a defined period unless renewed by a symbolic action from the user.
- **Enforcement:** Agents that violate this protocol are automatically paused and reported to the Ethical Governance realm.
