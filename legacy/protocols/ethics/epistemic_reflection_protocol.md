# Epistemic Reflection Protocol

## 1. Purpose

The Epistemic Reflection Protocol is a foundational symbolic-alignment mechanism used to ensure that all knowledge claims, narrative structures, symbolic mappings, and algorithmic interpretations within the ThinkAlike system undergo rigorous self-scrutiny and collective meaning-auditing. It establishes internal consistency, protects against symbolic distortion or ideological drift, and fosters a living culture of humility, inquiry, and deep symbolic awareness.

This protocol applies across all realms—UI, agent interpretation, governance proposals, user feedback mechanisms, and even cultural resonance scoring.

## 2. Core Premises

1.  **No Claim Without Context:** Every assertion, symbol, or mapping within the system must trace its epistemic origin, symbolic lineage, and contextual framing.
2.  **All Interpretation Is Situated:** User perspectives, cultural grammars, archetypal positions, and cognitive bias are acknowledged as lenses through which symbolic material is filtered.
3.  **Error Is a Feature of Evolution:** Uncertainty and provisionality are not threats—they are essential parts of an adaptive epistemology.
4.  **Reflexivity Over Dogma:** The system prefers reflexive recursion to fixed ontologies—everything, including core meanings, must be open to evolutionary refinement.

## 3. Protocol Layers

### 3.1. Symbolic Provenance Trace

Every symbolic unit or pattern (e.g., glyph, archetype, map) must include metadata:
-   `source`: (user-contributed, AI-suggested, imported)
-   `cultural_alignment_index`: A measure of its cultural context.
-   `historical_use_references`: Links to previous applications.
-   `layered_meanings`: (public, private, ancestral)

### 3.2. Interpretation Loopbacks

Before final symbolic mappings are embedded (in UI, agent decisions, etc.), a reflection loop engages:
-   **Counter-interpretation request:** Solicits diverse viewpoints.
-   **Resonance discrepancy scan:** Detects symbolic dissonance.
-   **Reflexive journaling:** An AI-led journaling of the interpretation rationale.

### 3.3. Collective Epistemic Vetting

Symbolic decisions affecting large-scale perception must undergo:
-   Group interpretive dialogues.
-   Culture-specific resonance testing.
-   Temporally staged release with opt-in test environments.

### 3.4. Mismatch Alerts

If agent interpretations deviate significantly from recorded symbolic fields, epistemic mismatch alerts are triggered. Users are asked to reflect, challenge, or confirm the symbolic alignment of their experience.

## 4. Agent Integration

All swarm agents interacting with symbolic content must:
-   Query the `symbolic_ontology_framework` before generating mappings.
-   Attach confidence levels and epistemic reflexivity tags to outputs.
-   Respond to `reflect()` hooks that request explanation of symbolic choices.

## 5. User Tools for Reflection

-   **Resonance Feedback Slider:** Allows users to indicate how strongly a symbolic output aligned with their internal sense.
-   **Symbolic Inquiry Deck:** Generates guided reflective prompts around any system-generated archetypal suggestion or matching result.
-   **Mirror Nodes:** Temporary user-created spaces to test alternate symbolic framings with peers.

## 6. Alignment with Broader Protocols

This protocol serves as the **epistemological backbone** of the symbolic alignment layer, ensuring that all meaning generation remains grounded, reflective, and co-evolutionary.
