# Consent Protocol

## 1. Vision & Purpose

Consent is the sacred foundation of all interactions within the ThinkAlike ecosystem. It is an active, informed, and freely given agreement from a user, never assumed or coerced. This protocol establishes the universal principles and requirements for obtaining, managing, and respecting user consent, ensuring that every individual retains sovereignty over their data, identity, and experience.

Its purpose is to transform consent from a passive checkbox into a conscious, ritualized act of trust and agreement, embedded in the fabric of the platform.

## 2. Core Principles of Consent

-   **Active & Explicit:** Consent must be obtained through a clear, affirmative action from the user. It is never implied or inferred from silence or inaction.
-   **Informed & Specific:** Users must be provided with clear, concise, and easily understandable information about what they are consenting to, including the purpose, scope, duration, and any potential risks or implications.
-   **Freely Given & Uncoerced:** Consent must be voluntary and free from any form of pressure, manipulation, or deceptive design. Users must not be penalized for withholding or withdrawing consent.
-   **Granular & Contextual:** Users must have the ability to give consent for specific purposes and contexts, rather than being forced into all-or-nothing choices.
-   **Easily Revocable:** Withdrawing consent must be as easy as giving it. The process for revocation must be clear, accessible, and honored immediately by the system.

## 3. Protocol Specification

### 3.1. General Requirements

-   **Clarity of Language:** All consent requests must be written in plain, accessible language, avoiding legalistic or technical jargon.
-   **Separation of Concerns:** Requests for consent must be clearly distinguished from other terms of service or user agreements.
-   **No Pre-checked Boxes:** All consent options must be unchecked by default.

### 3.2. Consent Types

This protocol governs all forms of consent within the ecosystem, including but not limited to:

-   **Data Consent:** Governs the collection, use, storage, and sharing of user data. This is further detailed in the [Data Consent Protocol](/protocols/ethics/data_consent_protocol.md).
-   **Interaction Consent:** Consent to engage in specific interactions, such as a Narrative Duet, a ritual, or a connection with another user.
-   **Procedural Consent:** Consent for the system to perform specific actions on the user's behalf, such as forking their identity or participating in a governance vote.
-   **AI Interpretation Consent:** Consent for AI agents to interpret a user's data for purposes like personalization or calculating a Resonance Score.

### 3.3. Consent Logging

-   **Immutable Record:** A verifiable, timestamped record of every consent action (granting or revocation) MUST be created and stored in a secure, tamper-proof log.
-   **Traceability:** This log must be linked to the relevant data or interaction via the [Data Traceability Protocol](/protocols/data/data_traceability_protocol.md).
-   **User Accessibility:** Users MUST have easy access to a clear and understandable history of all their consent decisions and the ability to manage them from a central location.

### 3.4. Revocation

-   **Immediate Effect:** Upon revocation of consent, the system MUST immediately cease the corresponding data processing or interaction.
-   **Data Handling on Revocation:** The protocol must clearly define what happens to a user's data when consent is revoked (e.g., deletion, anonymization), in line with the system's data retention policies.
-   **System-Wide Honor:** Revocations must be honored globally across all system components and agents.

## 4. Governance

-   Adherence to this protocol is mandatory for all components and agents within the ThinkAlike ecosystem.
-   Violations will be handled by the [Symbolic Resolution Protocol](/protocols/governance/symbolic_resolution_protocol.md) and may result in the deactivation of the offending component or agent.
