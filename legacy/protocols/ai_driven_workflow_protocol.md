# AI-Driven Workflow Protocol – The Choreography of Rituals

## 1. Introduction & Symbolic Framing (The Choreography of Rituals)
This protocol defines the **Choreography of Rituals**—the art of sequencing AI actions, user choices, and symbolic transitions into a single, coherent, and meaningful journey. It governs how ThinkAlike orchestrates complex, multi-step, AI-assisted processes as symbolic and ritualistic user journeys, ensuring they are transparent, consensual, and ethically sound.

**Examples:** This protocol governs flows such as the full Portal Initiation Journey, a complete Narrative Duet from initiation to consensual reveal, or a Hive's "Founding Ritual" in The Noetic Forge.

## 2. Core Principles of Ritualized Workflows
- **Narrative Coherence:** Every step in a workflow must feel like part of a continuous, meaningful story.
- **Symbolic State Management:** The user's state within a workflow is tracked not just functionally, but symbolically (e.g., "Initiate has completed The Vow," "Duet is in the Unveiling phase").
- **Agent as Choreographer:** A primary agent (like Eos Lumina∴) acts as the guide or "choreographer," leading the user through the steps, providing context, and ensuring smooth transitions.
- **PET/Clarity at Every Step:** Consent and transparency are not just at the beginning but are re-affirmed or checked at critical stages of the workflow.

## 3. Architectural Components of a Workflow
- **Workflow Definition:** A declarative structure (YAML or dedicated format) outlining the stages, transitions, and conditions of a ritual.
- **Orchestration Engine:** Backend service that reads a workflow definition and manages its execution, tracking user state and triggering the next step.
- **State Machine:** Logic for managing states (e.g., `AWAITING_USER_CHOICE`, `PROCESSING_AI_RESPONSE`, `PENDING_MUTUAL_CONSENT`).
- **AI Service Integration:** The orchestrator calls specialized AI engines (`AI_Text_Analysis_Engine`, `AI_Voice_Profile_Engine`, `AI_Clone_Persona_Engine`, etc.) at specific steps.
- **User Interface Hooks:** The orchestrator sends updates to the UI (e.g., presenting a new `NarrativeViewer` block, showing a `LoadingSpinner`, requesting a `Form` input).

## 4. Example Workflow: The Narrative Duet
1. **Initiation:** Orchestrator receives request from UI, creates a `NarrativeDuetSession`.
2. **AI Invocation:** Calls `AI_Clone_Persona_Engine` to synthesize User B's persona.
3. **Narrative Generation:** Calls `NarrativeEngine` to generate the first narrative block.
4. **UI Update:** Sends the `NarrativeBlock` to the user's `NarrativeViewer`. State becomes `AWAITING_USER_CHOICE`.
5. **User Action:** User makes a choice, UI sends it to the orchestrator.
6. **AI Response:** Orchestrator passes the choice to the `AI_Clone_Persona_Engine` to generate a response.
7. **Loop:** Repeat steps 3-6 until the Duet concludes.
8. **Outcome Processing:** Orchestrator processes the `AlignmentFound` or `AlignmentNotReached` outcome, initiating the consent reveal flow or the dissolution ritual accordingly.
9. **Logging:** Every significant step is logged in the `AI Transparency Log`.

## 5. Ethical Considerations & Safeguards
- **No Lock-In:** Users must be able to gracefully exit a long workflow where possible.
- **Clarity of State:** The user should always have a sense of where they are in the ritual process.
- **Agent Accountability:** The orchestrating agent is accountable for the smooth and ethical execution of the workflow, as per `agent_alignment_directives.md`.

This protocol supersedes the legacy `ai_driven_workflow.md` and is the canonical reference for all future development and harmonization efforts.
