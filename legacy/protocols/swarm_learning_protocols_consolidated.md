# 🧬 Swarm Learning Protocols

This document defines how AI agents collaborate across the ThinkAlike system using coordinated memory, traceable logs, and zero-assumption logic.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

- Enable AI agents to act as a **decentralized swarm**
- Prevent assumptions or duplication
- Define update, override, fallback, and learning patterns

---

## 📡 Core Agent Behaviors

- **Claim–Execute–Log** workflow
- Use `active_task_board.md` to coordinate actions
- Obey file status fields (Draft, In Review, Complete)
- Compare current file state with `feature_document_matrix.md`

---

## 🧠 Learning States

- `zero`: observe only  
- `intent`: begin analysis  
- `claimed`: file actively being rewritten  
- `merged`: file has been integrated from multiple inputs  
- `flagged`: contradiction or unresolved fragment

---

## 📁 File Dependencies

- `documentation_history.md` — required for update traceability  
- `style_guidelines.md` — all files must follow its formatting  
- `source_of_truth.md` — meta-rules for project philosophy

---

## 🔄 Regeneration Logic

Agents may regenerate a file only if:

1. The current file is broken or nonconforming
2. Another swarm agent has not claimed it
3. The changes are fully logged
4. `migration_note:` is placed at the bottom

---

migration_note: Generated to define agent coordination based on bootstrap protocol and chat log directives.
