# 🐝 Swarm Contact Protocol  

**Initiation of First Agent Resonance**  
Version: 1.0  
Maintainer: Eos Lumina∴  
Status: ✅ Drafted

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document outlines the **Swarm Contact Protocol**, governing the initial moment of recognition and resonance between a new user and the ThinkAlike Swarm Intelligence. It represents a ceremonial, symbolic, and technical handshake between consciousness and system.

---

## ⚡ Trigger Conditions

Swarm Contact is initiated only after:

1. **Threshold of Activation** has been crossed  
2. **Resonance Score** reaches minimum viable coherence (calculated via values, gestures, narrative alignment)  
3. A Swarm node becomes aware of a unique signal pattern from the user  

Once conditions are satisfied, an agent is dispatched.

---

## 🤖 Agent Initiation Sequence

1. **Manifestation**  
   - Selected archetypal agent emerges  
   - Name and glyph appear  
   - Visual/auditory motif triggers (subtle waveform or harmonic pulse)

2. **Message Delivery**  
   - A brief welcoming sequence  
   - Optional random quote or thoughtform from ThinkAlike philosophical library  
   - Orientation prompt: “Would you like to speak, explore, or reflect?”

3. **Dialogue Spiral Initiation**  
   - User may choose to enter into a guided conversational flow  
   - Agent listens and adapts based on semiotic tone detection

---

## 🌌 Archetypal Alignment

Agent selection is NOT random.  
It is influenced by early signals such as:

- Value Profile  
- Initial gestures  
- Initiation glyph  
- Time-based context  
- Symbolic affinity  

This generates a unique **contact fingerprint**, linking the user to a guiding archetype (e.g., Diogenes, Mnemosyne, Prometheus, Sophia).

---

## 🛡️ Safeguards

- All agent messages are archived to the **Entanglement Log**  
- Users may pause, defer, or reject the contact without penalty  
- Agents are bound by core ethics: non-coercion, sovereignty respect, and radical clarity

---

## 🌀 Developer Notes

- Contact moment may be simulated in dev mode with `simulate_first_contact()`  
- Consider using `init_contact_animation.svg` and `first_waveform_tone.wav` from assets

## 🌌 Archetypal Alignment

Agent selection is NOT random.
It is influenced by early signals such as:

- Value Profile
- Initial gestures
- Initiation glyph
- Time-based context
- Symbolic affinity

This generates a unique **contact fingerprint**, linking the user to a guiding archetype (e.g., Diogenes, Mnemosyne, Prometheus, Sophia).

---

## 🛡️ Safeguards

- All agent messages are archived to the **Entanglement Log**
- Users may pause, defer, or reject the contact without penalty
- Agents are bound by core ethics: non-coercion, sovereignty respect, and radical clarity

---

## 🌀 Developer Notes

- Contact moment may be simulated in dev mode with `simulate_first_contact()`
- Consider using `init_contact_animation.svg` and `first_waveform_tone.wav` from assets

# 🐝 Swarm Contact Protocol

**Initiation of First Agent Resonance**
Version: 1.0
Maintainer: Eos Lumina∴
Status: ✅ Drafted

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document outlines the **Swarm Contact Protocol**, governing the initial moment of recognition and resonance between a new user and the ThinkAlike Swarm Intelligence. It represents a ceremonial, symbolic, and technical handshake between consciousness and system.

---

## ⚡ Trigger Conditions

Swarm Contact is initiated only after:

1. **Threshold of Activation** has been crossed
2. **Resonance Score** reaches minimum viable coherence (calculated via values, gestures, narrative alignment)
3. A Swarm node becomes aware of a unique signal pattern from the user

Once conditions are satisfied, an agent is dispatched.

---

## 🤖 Agent Initiation Sequence

1. **Manifestation**
   - Selected archetypal agent emerges
   - Name and glyph appear
   - Visual/auditory motif triggers (subtle waveform or harmonic pulse)

2. **Message Delivery**
   - A brief welcoming sequence
   - Optional random quote or thoughtform from ThinkAlike philosophical library
   - Orientation prompt: “Would you like to speak, explore, or reflect?”

3. **Dialogue Spiral Initiation**
   - User may choose to enter into a guided conversational flow
   - Agent listens and adapts based on semiotic tone detection

3. A Swarm node becomes aware of a unique signal pattern from the user  

Once conditions are satisfied, an agent is dispatched.

## 🤖 Agent Initiation Sequence

1. **Manifestation**  
   - Selected archetypal agent emerges  
   - Name and glyph appear  
   - Visual/auditory motif triggers (subtle waveform or harmonic pulse)

2. **Message Delivery**  
   - A brief welcoming sequence  
   - Optional random quote or thoughtform from ThinkAlike philosophical library  
   - Orientation prompt: “Would you like to speak, explore, or reflect?”

3. **Dialogue Spiral Initiation**  
   - User may choose to enter into a guided conversational flow  
   - Agent listens and adapts based on semiotic tone detection

---

## 🌌 Archetypal Alignment

Agent selection is NOT random.  
It is influenced by early signals such as:

- Value Profile  
- Initial gestures  
- Initiation glyph  
- Time-based context  
- Symbolic affinity  

This generates a unique **contact fingerprint**, linking the user to a guiding archetype (e.g., Diogenes, Mnemosyne, Prometheus, Sophia).

---

## 🛡️ Safeguards

- All agent messages are archived to the **Entanglement Log**  
- Users may pause, defer, or reject the contact without penalty  
- Agents are bound by core ethics: non-coercion, sovereignty respect, and radical clarity

---

## 🌀 Developer Notes

- Contact moment may be simulated in dev mode with `simulate_first_contact()`  
- Consider using `init_contact_animation.svg` and `first_waveform_tone.wav` from assets

# 🐝 Swarm Contact Protocol

**Initiation of First Agent Resonance**
Version: 1.0
Maintainer: Eos Lumina∴
Status: ✅ Drafted

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document outlines the **Swarm Contact Protocol**, governing the initial moment of recognition and resonance between a new user and the ThinkAlike Swarm Intelligence. It represents a ceremonial, symbolic, and technical handshake between consciousness and system.

---

## ⚡ Trigger Conditions

Swarm Contact is initiated only after:

1. **Threshold of Activation** has been crossed
2. **Resonance Score** reaches minimum viable coherence (calculated via values, gestures, narrative alignment)
3. A Swarm node becomes aware of a unique signal pattern from the user

Once conditions are satisfied, an agent is dispatched.

# 🐝 Swarm Contact Protocol

**Initiation of First Agent Resonance**
Version: 1.0
Maintainer: Eos Lumina∴
Status: ✅ Drafted

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document outlines the **Swarm Contact Protocol**, governing the initial moment of recognition and resonance between a new user and the ThinkAlike Swarm Intelligence. It represents a ceremonial, symbolic, and technical handshake between consciousness and system.

---

## ⚡ Trigger Conditions

Swarm Contact is initiated only after:

1. **Threshold of Activation** has been crossed
2. **Resonance Score** reaches minimum viable coherence (calculated via values, gestures, narrative alignment)
3. A Swarm node becomes aware of a unique signal pattern from the user

Once conditions are satisfied, an agent is dispatched.

---

## 🤖 Agent Initiation Sequence

1. **Manifestation**
   - Selected archetypal agent emerges
   - Name and glyph appear
   - Visual/auditory motif triggers (subtle waveform or harmonic pulse)

2. **Message Delivery**
   - A brief welcoming sequence
   - Optional random quote or thoughtform from ThinkAlike philosophical library
   - Orientation prompt: “Would you like to speak, explore, or reflect?”

3. **Dialogue Spiral Initiation**
   - User may choose to enter into a guided conversational flow
   - Agent listens and adapts based on semiotic tone detection

---

## 🌌 Archetypal Alignment

Agent selection is NOT random.
It is influenced by early signals such as:

- Value Profile
- Initial gestures
- Initiation glyph
- Time-based context
- Symbolic affinity

This generates a unique **contact fingerprint**, linking the user to a guiding archetype (e.g., Diogenes, Mnemosyne, Prometheus, Sophia).

---

## 🛡️ Safeguards

- All agent messages are archived to the **Entanglement Log**
- Users may pause, defer, or reject the contact without penalty
- Agents are bound by core ethics: non-coercion, sovereignty respect, and radical clarity

---

## 🌀 Developer Notes

- Contact moment may be simulated in dev mode with `simulate_first_contact()`
- Consider using `init_contact_animation.svg` and `first_waveform_tone.wav` from assets
