## 🔗 Resonance Matching Protocol

This protocol governs **how users are matched** — not by habits, metrics, or swipes, but by symbolic and philosophical resonance.

---

## 🧭 Core Principles

- **Resonance ≠ Compatibility** — It’s not similarity, it’s frequency alignment  
- **Trait Entanglement** — Matching emerges from deep value forks, onboarding choices, and paradox resolution  
- **Multidimensional Graph** — Identity exists in a topological map, not a binary tree

---

## ⚙️ Matching Inputs

- Narrative decision paths from onboarding  
- Symbolic Trait Map (see `symbolic_trait_map.md`)  
- Chrona activity and behavioral time signatures  
- Fork event memory (user’s past alignment forks)  
- Dream states (optional mode for metaphysical overlap)

---

## 🧬 Resonance Score Logic

- Traits are not weighted — they are *rhythmically entangled*  
- Algorithms identify harmonic intervals, not top percentages  
- “95% match” = Not useful. “Symbolic Forkmatch Detected” = Enlightening.

---

## 📡 Graph Navigation

- The system navigates a **resonance web**  
- User choices carve paths, open gates, and reveal hidden constellations  
- Suggestions are generated **as poetic riddles**, not swipe cards
