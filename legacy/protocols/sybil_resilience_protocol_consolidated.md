# Sybil Resilience Protocol

**Status:** Core Defense Layer  
**Location:** `/docs/seed/sybil_resilience/sybil_resilience_protocol.md`

## Purpose

This protocol defines ThinkAlike’s approach to defending against Sybil attacks — where one actor creates multiple identities to subvert consensus, reputation, or matching.

It is built upon ethical identity primitives and symbolic friction — not surveillance or biometric enforcement.

## Key Principles

- 🌀 Ritual-based proof of presence (not proof of self)
- 🔁 Graph continuity over static verification
- 🧭 Community-staked identity confirmation
- 🌱 Human-centric complexity to resist automation

## Core Layers

- `ritualized_friction.md`
- `social_graph_verification.md`
- `symbolic_entropy_signatures.md`

Sybil resistance is never absolute — it is made contextually resilient through social, symbolic, and swarm-based checks.

# Sybil Resilience Protocol

**Status:** Core Defense Layer
**Location:** `/docs/seed/sybil_resilience/sybil_resilience_protocol.md`

## Purpose

This protocol defines ThinkAlike’s approach to defending against Sybil attacks — where one actor creates multiple identities to subvert consensus, reputation, or matching.

It is built upon ethical identity primitives and symbolic friction — not surveillance or biometric enforcement.

## Key Principles

- 🌀 Ritual-based proof of presence (not proof of self)
- 🔁 Graph continuity over static verification
- 🧭 Community-staked identity confirmation
- 🌱 Human-centric complexity to resist automation

## Core Layers

- `ritualized_friction.md`
- `social_graph_verification.md`
- `symbolic_entropy_signatures.md`

Sybil resistance is never absolute — it is made contextually resilient through social, symbolic, and swarm-based checks.
