# Persona Calibration Initiative (PCI) Specification

> **Status:** In Development
> **Version:** 1.0
> **Maintained by:** ThinkAlike Core Team
> **Integration Point:** Portal Realm, Eos Lumina System

---

## Overview

The Persona Calibration Initiative (PCI) is a voluntary system where ThinkAlike contributors can create detailed "Test Persona Profiles" to help test, validate, and refine ThinkAlike's matching, personalization, and insight-generating algorithms. This system strictly adheres to ThinkAlike's core principles of User Sovereignty, Radical Transparency, and Ethical AI.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. User Sovereignty
Contributors have absolute control over:
- Their participation decision
- The data they share
- How their data is used for testing
- Data retention and deletion

### 2. Radical Transparency (UI as Validation)
Every step must be exceptionally clear:
- What data is being requested and why
- How it will be used in algorithm testing
- Results of any tests involving their profile
- Clear visibility into all processes

### 3. Ethical AI (Eos Lumina as Steward)
Eos Lumina∴ facilitates this process as an ethical guide:
- Ensures informed consent at every step
- Provides clarity and context
- Champions contributor agency
- Acts as partner in co-creation, not data harvester

### 4. Purpose Limitation
PCI data is exclusively for algorithm testing and refinement by the contributor pool. It is firewalled from other uses unless explicit, separate consent is given.

### 5. Voluntary Participation
No contributor is ever required to participate. PCI is strictly opt-in for those wishing to help refine the platform's core intelligence.

---

## System Architecture

### Phase 1: Foundation & Consent Framework
- Opt-in mechanism with granular consent
- Eos Lumina dialogue system for onboarding and support
- Test Persona Profile data structure (see below)
- Profile dashboard for consent and data management

### Phase 2: Profile Building Mechanisms
- Symbolic questions integration
- Value prioritization module
- Narrative sharing module
- Preference tagging module

### Phase 3: Algorithm Test Bench & Feedback Loop
- Algorithm selection interface
- Test execution and result transparency
- Contributor feedback system

### Phase 4: Data Governance & Algorithm Refinement
- Data governance and retention
- Anonymization and audit
- Feedback-driven algorithm improvement

---

## Test Persona Profile Data Structure (TypeScript Example)
```typescript
interface TestPersonaProfile {
  contributor_id: string; // Pseudonymized for algorithm runs
  consent_status: {
    pci_opt_in: boolean;
    last_updated: timestamp;
    granular_permissions: {
      symbolic_responses: boolean;
      value_priorities: boolean;
      narrative_shares: boolean;
      preference_tags: boolean;
    };
  };
  profile_creation_date: timestamp;
  profile_last_modified: timestamp;
  data: {
    symbolic_responses: SymbolicResponse[];
    value_priorities: ValuePriority[];
    narrative_shares: NarrativeShare[];
    preference_tags: PreferenceTag[];
  };
  usage_log: AlgorithmTestUsage[];
}
```

- Granular permission controls
- Easy withdrawal mechanisms

### Algorithm Bias Risks
- Diverse contributor recruitment
- Bias detection in test results
- Iterative fairness improvements
