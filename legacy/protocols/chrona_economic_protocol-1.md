# Chrona Economic Protocol – System-Wide Specification

## 1. The Philosophy of Chrona (⧖) – The Currency of Being

Chrona is not money. It is the symbolic representation of sacred time, creative energy, and contributions to the commons. Chrona is a tool for acknowledging and facilitating the flow of value in a post-capitalist context, aligned with the Alchemical Interface Initiative.

**Core Principles:**
- **Non-Extractive:** Chrona cannot be hoarded for speculative gain or used to exert coercive power. Its value is in its flow and use.
- **Value of Contribution:** Recognizes diverse forms of value—creative work, emotional labor, community stewardship, resource sharing, and more.
- **Time-Based Foundation:** Rooted in the idea that an individual's time and life-energy are a fundamental source of value.
- **Gift & Reciprocity:** Blends gift economy principles with transparent, equitable exchange.

## 2. Chrona Generation & Flow (The Wellspring)

- **Universal Basic Income (UBI):** Chrona is regularly generated and distributed to all verified members as a foundational UBI. Initial parameters and adjustment processes are governed by the community.
- **Earning via Contribution:**
  - Completing Quests on the Swarm Roadmap.
  - Receiving Echoes of Recognition (symbolic endorsements) from others.
  - Providing services or creative works in the Marketplace.
  - Hosting or facilitating in Housing/Travel realms.
  - Facilitating rituals or governance processes within Hives.
- **Chrona Decay/Circulation Tax (Conceptual):** Chrona may subtly decay over time if hoarded, encouraging circulation and use rather than accumulation.

---

## 3. The Marketplace Realm – A Bazaar of Resonant Offers

- **Purpose:** Interface for users and Hives to offer/request goods, services, skills, or creative works, valued in Chrona or offered as gifts/barter.
- **Listings:** Marketplace listings use Card components, clear descriptions, Chrona value, and ProfileBadge for trust.
- **Discovery:** Users find offers via search, category filters, and resonance-based recommendations.
- **Transaction Ritual:** Accepting an offer, transferring Chrona, and confirming completion is a consensual, transparent ritual.

---

## 4. The Chrona Wallet

- The user's personal interface for viewing balance, transaction history, and sending/receiving Chrona.
- See [chrona_wallet_protocol.md](../features/wallet/chrona_wallet_protocol.md) for full specification.

---

## 5. Integration with Other Realms

- **Hives:** Manage collective treasuries, fund projects, and distribute Chrona to members.
- **Housing & Travel:** Chrona can be part of exchange agreements.
- **Governance:** Economic parameters (UBI rate, decay rate, etc.) are subject to platform governance.
- **Noetic Forge:** Exceptional contributions may be recognized with Chrona grants from a community fund.

---

## 6. Economic Governance & Participatory Economics

- Economic decisions (UBI, decay, etc.) are made through participatory governance.
- Equitable outcomes are ensured by design and ongoing review.
- See [governance_specification.md](../realms/governance/governance_specification.md) and [parecon_and_thinkalike_integration.md](../reference/parecon_and_thinkalike_integration.md) for deeper theory and governance linkages.

---

## 7. PET/Clarity & Ethical Considerations

- **Transparency:** All transactions on the public ledger (anonymized/pseudonymized) are traceable. A user's own transaction history is fully visible to them.
- **Fairness:** UBI and design promote equity and access.
- **No Speculation:** Chrona's design (including potential decay) discourages speculative hoarding.
