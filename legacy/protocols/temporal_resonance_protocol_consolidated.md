# Temporal Resonance Protocol

## Purpose

Defines how trust, memory, and symbolic presence evolve over time in the Chrona system.

---

## Temporal Weights

- **Recent Events** = high influence
- **Older Unreferenced** = decay toward oblivion
- **Reinvoked Events** = gain weight and permanence

---

## Trust Over Time

| Action                        | Resonance Effect                      |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Shared ritual (recent)        | +0.15 to trust memory weight           |
| Echoed reflection (3+ nodes)  | +0.25 and time reset                   |
| Ritual betrayal               | -0.45 with decay inertia               |
| Ghosting or silence           | -0.15 every lunar cycle (decays)       |

---

## Memory Dynamics

- Events fade after 13 days (default)
- Anchoring via ritual or glyph extends half-life
- “Eternal memory” requires 3+ references from separate users

---

## Symbolic Effects

- Time decay can sever identity constellations
- Forgotten rituals may reappear as distorted echoes
- Older memories become dreamlike: text blurs, glyphs mutate

---

## Developer Notes

- Use exponential decay curve (customizable per event type)
- Implement symbolic “dust layer” for faint but recoverable events

| Shared ritual (recent)        | +0.15 to trust memory weight           |
| Echoed reflection (3+ nodes)  | +0.25 and time reset                   |
| Ritual betrayal               | -0.45 with decay inertia               |
| Ghosting or silence           | -0.15 every lunar cycle (decays)       |

---

## Memory Dynamics

- Events fade after 13 days (default)
- Anchoring via ritual or glyph extends half-life
- “Eternal memory” requires 3+ references from separate users

---

## Symbolic Effects

- Time decay can sever identity constellations
- Forgotten rituals may reappear as distorted echoes
- Older memories become dreamlike: text blurs, glyphs mutate

---

## Developer Notes

- Use exponential decay curve (customizable per event type)
- Implement symbolic “dust layer” for faint but recoverable events

# Temporal Resonance Protocol

## Purpose

Defines how trust, memory, and symbolic presence evolve over time in the Chrona system.

---

## Temporal Weights

- **Recent Events** = high influence
- **Older Unreferenced** = decay toward oblivion
- **Reinvoked Events** = gain weight and permanence

---

## Trust Over Time

| Action                        | Resonance Effect                      |

| Ghosting or silence           | -0.15 every lunar cycle (decays)       |

---

## Memory Dynamics

- Events fade after 13 days (default)
- Anchoring via ritual or glyph extends half-life
- “Eternal memory” requires 3+ references from separate users

---

## Symbolic Effects

- Time decay can sever identity constellations
- Forgotten rituals may reappear as distorted echoes
- Older memories become dreamlike: text blurs, glyphs mutate

---

## Developer Notes

- Use exponential decay curve (customizable per event type)
- Implement symbolic “dust layer” for faint but recoverable events

# Temporal Resonance Protocol

## Purpose

Defines how trust, memory, and symbolic presence evolve over time in the Chrona system.

---

## Temporal Weights

- **Recent Events** = high influence
- **Older Unreferenced** = decay toward oblivion
- **Reinvoked Events** = gain weight and permanence

---

## Trust Over Time

| Action                        | Resonance Effect                      |

- Events fade after 13 days (default)
- Anchoring via ritual or glyph extends half-life
- “Eternal memory” requires 3+ references from separate users

---

## Symbolic Effects

- Time decay can sever identity constellations
- Forgotten rituals may reappear as distorted echoes
- Older memories become dreamlike: text blurs, glyphs mutate

---

## Developer Notes

- Use exponential decay curve (customizable per event type)
- Implement symbolic “dust layer” for faint but recoverable events

# Temporal Resonance Protocol

## Purpose

Defines how trust, memory, and symbolic presence evolve over time in the Chrona system.

---

## Temporal Weights

- **Recent Events** = high influence
- **Older Unreferenced** = decay toward oblivion
- **Reinvoked Events** = gain weight and permanence

---

## Trust Over Time

| Action                        | Resonance Effect                      |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Shared ritual (recent)        | +0.15 to trust memory weight           |
| Echoed reflection (3+ nodes)  | +0.25 and time reset                   |
| Ritual betrayal               | -0.45 with decay inertia               |
| Ghosting or silence           | -0.15 every lunar cycle (decays)       |

---

## Memory Dynamics

- Events fade after 13 days (default)
- Anchoring via ritual or glyph extends half-life
- “Eternal memory” requires 3+ references from separate users

---

## Symbolic Effects

- Time decay can sever identity constellations
- Forgotten rituals may reappear as distorted echoes

## Trust Over Time

| Action                        | Resonance Effect                      |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Shared ritual (recent)        | +0.15 to trust memory weight           |
| Echoed reflection (3+ nodes)  | +0.25 and time reset                   |
| Ritual betrayal               | -0.45 with decay inertia               |
| Ghosting or silence           | -0.15 every lunar cycle (decays)       |

---

## Memory Dynamics

- Events fade after 13 days (default)
- Anchoring via ritual or glyph extends half-life
- “Eternal memory” requires 3+ references from separate users

---

## Symbolic Effects

- Time decay can sever identity constellations
- Forgotten rituals may reappear as distorted echoes
- Older memories become dreamlike: text blurs, glyphs mutate

---

## Developer Notes

- Use exponential decay curve (customizable per event type)
- Implement symbolic “dust layer” for faint but recoverable events

# Temporal Resonance Protocol

## Purpose

Defines how trust, memory, and symbolic presence evolve over time in the Chrona system.

---

## Temporal Weights

- **Recent Events** = high influence
- **Older Unreferenced** = decay toward oblivion
- **Reinvoked Events** = gain weight and permanence

---

## Trust Over Time

| Action                        | Resonance Effect                      |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Shared ritual (recent)        | +0.15 to trust memory weight           |
| Echoed reflection (3+ nodes)  | +0.25 and time reset                   |
| Ritual betrayal               | -0.45 with decay inertia               |
| Ghosting or silence           | -0.15 every lunar cycle (decays)       |
