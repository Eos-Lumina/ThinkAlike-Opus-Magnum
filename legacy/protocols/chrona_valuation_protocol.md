## ⧖ Chrona Valuation Protocol

Chrona is the symbolic time-based currency of ThinkAlike. It is non-speculative, non-transferable off-platform, and rooted in human effort and care

---

## 💠 Core Properties

- 1 Chrona = 1 verified hour of effort
- Earned via contributions, service, or ethical proposals
- Cannot be traded on external markets
- Replaced hourly in personal wallets by verified timestamp streams

---

## 🧠 Earning Rules

- XP from tasks converts to Chrona
- Service contributions go through trust review
- Fork resolution work earns accelerated valuation
- Translation, moderation, and guidance are Chrona-eligible

---

## 🔐 Safeguards

- Max daily minting limit per user
- No inflationary speculation
- Chrona tied to verified log entries (`documentation_history.md`)
- AI agents cannot self-issue Chrona

> "Value is time spent in alignment — not capital accumulated."
