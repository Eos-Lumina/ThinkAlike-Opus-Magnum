# Clarity Protocol v0.9.2  
## Core Requirements  
- All user data must be **encrypted at rest** (AES-256) and **in transit** (TLS 1.3+)  
- Resonance score changes require **explainable AI logs**  
- Clone interactions must never expose PII until 85%+ alignment  

## Swarm Compatibility  
- API endpoints must support JSON-LD + RDF triples  
- All components tagged with `X-Clarity-Compliance: true`
