## 🔗 Resonance Matching Protocol

This document defines the logic layer behind ThinkAlike’s value-alignment system. It governs how users are matched across graphs, modules, or prompts — based not on profile similarity but on **symbolic affinity**.

---

## 🧭 Matching Principles

- **Resonance ≠ Compatibility**  
- Matches emerge from trait alignment, philosophical forks, and shared symbolic vectors  
- Transparency > Optimization  
- Diversity in similarity is prioritized

---

## 🔍 Core Inputs

- Forked onboarding traits (see `onboarding_forking_map.md`)  
- Passive interaction markers (opt-in)  
- Explicit trait tags (e.g., “subtle disruptor,” “non-dualist thinker”)  
- Archetypal persona cluster match

---

## ⚖️ Bias Control

- Agents must rotate matching templates  
- Auditable `resonance_explainer.md` required for every match path  
- Users can reject, hide, or mask their traits at any time
