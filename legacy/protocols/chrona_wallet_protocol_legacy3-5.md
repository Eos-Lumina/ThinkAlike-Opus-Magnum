# Chrona Wallet Protocol – Keeper of Sacred Time

## 1. Introduction: The Keeper of Sacred Time

The Chrona Wallet is the user's sacred interface to the Chrona economy—a ritual space for witnessing, sending, and receiving the currency of time, energy, and contribution. It is both a practical tool and a symbolic artifact, designed to honor the flow of value in a post-capitalist, resonance-driven system.

## 2. Core Features

- **Balance Display:** Shows current Chrona (⧖) balance, UBI accrual, and pending transactions.
- **Transaction History:** Chronological, filterable list of all incoming/outgoing Chrona, with symbolic tags (e.g., Quest Reward, Gift, Ritual, Marketplace, UBI).
- **Send/Request Chrona:** Flows for sending Chrona to others (individuals, Hives) or requesting Chrona, with optional message and symbolic intent.
- **UBI Display:** Clearly shows UBI accrual, next distribution, and historical UBI received.
- **Offer/Marketplace Integration:** Direct links to offers, requests, and Marketplace transactions.

---

## 3. UI/UX & Symbolic Design

- **WalletCard Component:** Central UI element, visually representing the user's Chrona balance, resonance signature, and recent activity.
- **Transaction Ritual Animation:** Each transaction (send/receive) is accompanied by a symbolic ritual animation (e.g., invocation glyph, resonance pulse, affirmation phrase).
- **Accessibility:** Fully accessible (WCAG AAA), with PET/Clarity-aligned tooltips and explanations for all actions.
- **Profile Integration:** User's ProfileCard and Hive affiliations are visible within the wallet for context.

---

## 4. Security & PET/Clarity

- **Invocation Phrase Confirmation:** For significant transactions, the user must enter their personal Invocation Phrase as a ritual confirmation step.
- **PET/Clarity:** All wallet actions are transparent, auditable, and explained in clear language. Users can export their full transaction history.
- **Privacy:** Transaction details are pseudonymized on the public ledger; only the user sees their full details.
- **Session Security:** Wallet actions require active session authentication; sensitive actions may require re-authentication.

---

## 5. Integration with Other Systems

- **Chrona Economy:** Fully integrated with the Chrona protocol for balance, UBI, and transaction logic.
- **Marketplace:** Direct access to offers, requests, and transaction history for Marketplace activity.
- **Hives:** Ability to send/request Chrona to/from Hives, view Hive treasury, and participate in collective funding.
- **Governance:** Wallet displays voting power or economic participation in governance processes.

---

## 6. The Transaction as Ritual

- **Transaction Ritual Protocol:** Every Chrona transfer is a ritualized process, not just a technical transaction. The protocol includes:
  - Review of transaction details and symbolic intent.
  - Invocation Phrase entry for confirmation.
  - Ritual animation and affirmation upon completion.
- See [transaction_ritual_protocol.md](../transaction_ritual_protocol.md) for the full ritual flow and symbolic logic.
