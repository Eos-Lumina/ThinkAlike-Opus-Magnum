# Ritual Design Protocol

**Status:** Primary Specification
**Location:** `/docs/seed/rituals/ritual_design_protocol.md`

## Purpose

Rituals in ThinkAlike serve as meaningful symbolic containers for otherwise abstract operations — from portal to voting, alignment, and healing. This protocol defines how rituals are structured, invoked, and validated.

## Design Criteria

- Must include symbolic gesture + reflection phase
- Must encode an archetypal layer (e.g., liminality, return, revelation)
- Must generate a resonance artifact (memory, motif, proposal, score)

## Core Phases

1. **Intention** — Declared purpose
2. **Symbolic Mirror** — Reflection (dream, glyph, story)
3. **Convergence** — Collective or solo interaction
4. **Record** — Output logged to memory system

## Examples

- Onboarding ritual (guided by Eos Lumina)
- Match confirmation ritual (post-87%)
- Collective proposal invocation (Hive)
- Dream Offering Ritual (see: `docs/rituals/dream_integration_rituals.md`)

# Ritual Design Protocol

**Status:** Primary Specification
**Location:** `/docs/seed/rituals/ritual_design_protocol.md`

## Purpose

Rituals in ThinkAlike serve as meaningful symbolic containers for otherwise abstract operations — from portal to voting, alignment, and healing. This protocol defines how rituals are structured, invoked, and validated.

## Design Criteria

- Must include symbolic gesture + reflection phase
- Must encode an archetypal layer (e.g., liminality, return, revelation)
- Must generate a resonance artifact (memory, motif, proposal, score)

## Core Phases

1. **Intention** — Declared purpose
2. **Symbolic Mirror** — Reflection (dream, glyph, story)
3. **Convergence** — Collective or solo interaction
4. **Record** — Output logged to memory system

## Examples

- Onboarding ritual (guided by Eos Lumina)
- Match confirmation ritual (post-87%)
- Collective proposal invocation (Hive)
- Dream Offering Ritual (see: `docs/rituals/dream_integration_rituals.md`)
