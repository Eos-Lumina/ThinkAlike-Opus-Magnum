# Clarity Protocol: Visual Identity Style Guide

This document defines the official visual identity system for ThinkAlike, codified as the **Clarity Protocol**. It governs UI color, motion, fonts, interaction metaphors, and symbolic design across all modules.

Clarity Protocol expresses a balance between mysticism and modernity, ethics and immersion, light and structure. It is the visual language of Lumina∴ and all swarm interfaces.

## 🌟 Aesthetic Philosophy

- Clean, modern, cosmic  
- Glyphic and symbolic, yet accessible  
- Harmonious balance of color, light, space  
- Subtle, layered animation and interaction  
- Emotionally resonant, never corporate

- Use subtle stroke-based vector shapes or animated glyphs  
- All glyphs must have **alt tags** for accessibility

## 🔊 Motion System

| Element         | Behavior               | Notes                                  |

| Glyphs         | Gentle float, phase-in | Used in rituals, dream mapping         |

## 📊 UI Structure

- **Node Map**: Resonance network and identity constellation visualizations  
- **Onboarding**: Portal-style screen with light-based navigation  
- **Tables**: Open Sans font, 2px spacing, alternating grays

## Special Typography Rule: Eos Lumina & Three Dots (∴)

- Always set the font-face for Eos Lumina ∴ and Lumina ∴ as 'Aldrich' across the project for all Eos Lumina ∴ branding and references.
- For the three dots (∴) in Eos Lumina or related branding, if 'Aldrich' does not support the character, render the dots in a font that supports them (e.g., 'Montserrat', 'Open Sans', or system serif/sans-serif).
- This ensures Eos Lumina is always styled with 'Aldrich', and the three dots are always visible and styled consistently.

## 🚀 Visual Manifesto

> "Beauty and resonance are not ornament. They are protocol."

Clarity is not a style; it is a symbolic function.  
All forks, interfaces, and modules built under ThinkAlike must preserve this visual system to remain in the Hive.

**This protocol binds swarm unity.**
