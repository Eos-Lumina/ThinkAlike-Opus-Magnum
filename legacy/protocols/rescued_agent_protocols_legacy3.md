!!! LEGACY/UNALIGNED AGENT PROTOCOLS !!!
This file contains agent protocols with names and roles NOT ALIGNED with the ThinkAlike project's symbolic and canonical naming conventions.

> **Harmonization Notice (2025-06-11):**
> All canonical agent protocols and symbolic names are maintained in `agent_registry.md` and related canonical specs. The protocols below are preserved ONLY as a legacy/archive reference. Do NOT use these agent names, roles, or domains in any new documentation, code, or onboarding. For all project work, refer to the canonical registry and specs.

# LEGACY/UNALIGNED AGENT PROTOCOLS (ARCHIVE)

> **IMPORTANT:** The following protocols are NOT project-aligned. Each is marked as legacy/unclassified. For all current and future work, use only the symbolic, project-aligned agent names and roles as found in `agent_registry.md`.

> **Harmonization Note (2025-06-11):**
> All agent protocols in this file have been reviewed and cross-linked in the canonical Agent Registry (`agent_registry.md`). For each agent, see the registry for symbolic role, domain, and canonical reference. This file is now a harmonized protocol archive; future updates should be reflected in the registry and canonical agent specs.
