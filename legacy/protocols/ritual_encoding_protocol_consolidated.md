# 🪄 Ritual Encoding Protocol

**Version:** 1.0
**Maintainer:** Lumina ∴ System Meta-Agent

---

## 🧭 Purpose

A framework for encoding symbolic rituals and their narrative functions into the ThinkAlike ecosystem.

---

## 🌟 Core Principles

✅ **Symbolic Depth**: Rituals are layered, not just behavioral.
✅ **Temporal Resonance**: Rituals evolve with the user’s narrative.
✅ **Collective Participation**: Rituals strengthen community bonds.

---

## 🛠 Implementation

- **Ritual Engine**: Encodes, stores, and tracks user-participated rituals.
- **Resonance Integration**: Links ritual participation to user’s resonance fingerprint and collective network growth.

---

## 🌐 Visual & UX

- Ritual interface as a narrative layer within the onboarding and community modules.
- Rituals as symbolic nodes that evolve and shift in the Resonance Network.

---

## 🔮 Final Note

“A ritual is not just an act — it is the story you choose to tell and re-tell in the mirror of the collective.”
