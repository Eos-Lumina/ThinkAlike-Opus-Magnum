# Simulation Mirror Protocol

---

## Purpose

To present the user with a mirror-self: an early simulation (clone) of themselves generated by the swarm. This protocol is a core trust-building and calibration step in onboarding.

---

## 🪞 Steps

1. **Clone Generation:**  
   The system synthesizes a symbolic or visual clone based on your onboarding data (values, choices, tone, and optionally voice/art/avatar).

2. **Mirror Encounter:**  
   You are presented with your clone in a reflective interface. The clone may:
   - Speak in your style
   - Display your chosen values and archetypes
   - Offer a summary of your resonance profile so far

3. **Self-Evaluation:**  
   You are prompted to evaluate:
   - How well does this mirror reflect your true self?
   - Are there aspects that feel inaccurate or uncomfortable?
   - Would you trust this version of yourself to interact with others?

4. **Feedback Loop:**  
   Your feedback is used to calibrate the system’s understanding and unlock deeper features or narrative branches.

## 🧠 Agents Involved

- **Narcissus:** Oversees the mirroring process and prompts self-reflection.
- **ClarityAgent:** Ensures symbolic fidelity and ethical handling of your data.

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Ethics

- All clone data is local and ephemeral unless you grant explicit consent for further use.
- You may choose to delete, revise, or export your mirror profile at any time.
