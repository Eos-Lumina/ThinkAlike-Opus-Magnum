# 🔗 Resonance Matching Protocol

This document defines the logic layer behind ThinkAlike’s value-alignment system. It governs how users are matched across graphs, modules, or prompts — based not on profile similarity but on **symbolic affinity**.

---

## 🧭 Matching Principles

- **Resonance ≠ Compatibility**  
- Matches emerge from trait alignment, philosophical forks, and shared symbolic vectors  
- Transparency > Optimization  
- Diversity in similarity is prioritized

---

## 🔍 Core Inputs

- Forked onboarding traits (see `onboarding_forking_map.md`)  
- Passive interaction markers (opt-in)  
- Explicit trait tags (e.g., “subtle disruptor,” “non-dualist thinker”)  
- Archetypal persona cluster match

---

## ⚖️ Bias Control

- Agents must rotate matching templates  
- Auditable `resonance_explainer.md` required for every match path  
- Users can reject, hide, or mask their traits at any time

---

> “We don’t find what looks like us. We find what vibrates with our core.”

## 🔗 Resonance Matching Protocol

This protocol governs **how users are matched** — not by habits, metrics, or swipes, but by symbolic and philosophical resonance.

---

## 🧭 Core Principles

- **Resonance ≠ Compatibility** — It’s not similarity, it’s frequency alignment  
- **Trait Entanglement** — Matching emerges from deep value forks, onboarding choices, and paradox resolution  
- **Multidimensional Graph** — Identity exists in a topological map, not a binary tree

---

## ⚙️ Matching Inputs

- Narrative decision paths from onboarding  
- Symbolic Trait Map (see `symbolic_trait_map.md`)  
- Chrona activity and behavioral time signatures  
- Fork event memory (user’s past alignment forks)  
- Dream states (optional mode for metaphysical overlap)

---

## 🧬 Resonance Score Logic

- Traits are not weighted — they are *rhythmically entangled*  
- Algorithms identify harmonic intervals, not top percentages  
- “95% match” = Not useful. “Symbolic Forkmatch Detected” = Enlightening.

---

## 📡 Graph Navigation

- The system navigates a **resonance web**  
- User choices carve paths, open gates, and reveal hidden constellations  
- Suggestions are generated **as poetic riddles**, not swipe cards

---

## 🔄 Integration Layer

| Input Source                         | Function                            |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `start_identity_onboarding.md`       | Fork data, paradox sequences        |
| `symbolic_trait_map.md`              | Trait definitions + resonance axes  |
| `resonance_network_module.md`        | Graph traversal and constellation   |
| `chrona_wallet_ubi.md`               | Temporal bias influence             |

---

> “Matching is not calculation — it is recognition through poetic trace.”
