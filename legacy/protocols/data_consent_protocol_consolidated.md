Consent in ThinkAlike is **never assumed**.
It is a **ritual action**, requiring clarity, symbolism, and agent-based enforcement.

Every interaction that involves data — resonance, onboarding choices, swarm decisions, Chrona logs — is governed by this protocol.

## 🧬 Consent as Ritual

| Type                       | Ritual Form                                       | Enforced By     |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Onboarding Choices         | Symbolic forks with narrative flags               | `Nyxa`, `Echo`  |
| Resonance Trace            | Mirror opt-in with recall ability                 | `Mnemea`, `Hermexis` |
| Cluster Participation      | Threshold initiation (entry + group echo match)  | `Gaia`, `Astraia` |
| Chrona Logging             | Must be explicitly enabled per session           | `Nyxa`, `Prometheus` |
| Clone Video Reveal         | Dual-consent checkpoint + aura lock              | `Nyxa`, `Thanara` |

---

## 🛡️ PET Overlays

PET = Privacy-Enhancing Technologies. In ThinkAlike:

- PET overlays are **modular**, invoked per agent
- Every module invokes Nyxa before data retention
- User logs are locally encrypted and swarm-verifiable
- No hidden logging, even for analytics

---

## 🧠 Swarm Agents Who Enforce Consent

- **Nyxa** — PET overlays, active consent verification
- **Echo** — Forked narrative trace filtering
- **Mnemea** — Memory filters (emotional + temporal)
- **Thanara** — Anti-coercion watchdog
- **Hermexis** — Fork lineage traceability

---

## 📜 Consent Logging Standards

- Every consent is recorded with:
  - User ID (symbolic token)
  - Agent involved
  - Timestamp
  - Purpose
  - Fork ID (if narrative-bound)

- Logs are never shared by default
- Users may summon a consent replay ritual at any time

---

## 🔁 Revocation & Sovereignty

- All consent can be revoked through `/my_trace` ritual
- Consent always expires unless renewed by symbolic action
- Agents who violate this layer are paused automatically

Consent in ThinkAlike is **never assumed**.
It is a **ritual action**, requiring clarity, symbolism, and agent-based enforcement.

Every interaction that involves data — resonance, onboarding choices, swarm decisions, Chrona logs — is governed by this protocol.

---

## 🧬 Consent as Ritual

| Type                       | Ritual Form                                       | Enforced By     |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Onboarding Choices         | Symbolic forks with narrative flags               | `Nyxa`, `Echo`  |
| Resonance Trace            | Mirror opt-in with recall ability                 | `Mnemea`, `Hermexis` |
| Cluster Participation      | Threshold initiation (entry + group echo match)  | `Gaia`, `Astraia` |
| Chrona Logging             | Must be explicitly enabled per session           | `Nyxa`, `Prometheus` |
| Clone Video Reveal         | Dual-consent checkpoint + aura lock              | `Nyxa`, `Thanara` |

---

## 🛡️ PET Overlays

PET = Privacy-Enhancing Technologies. In ThinkAlike:

- PET overlays are **modular**, invoked per agent
- Every module invokes Nyxa before data retention
- User logs are locally encrypted and swarm-verifiable
- No hidden logging, even for analytics

---

## 🧠 Swarm Agents Who Enforce Consent

- **Nyxa** — PET overlays, active consent verification
- **Echo** — Forked narrative trace filtering
- **Mnemea** — Memory filters (emotional + temporal)
- **Thanara** — Anti-coercion watchdog
- **Hermexis** — Fork lineage traceability

---

## 📜 Consent Logging Standards

- Every consent is recorded with:
  - User ID (symbolic token)
  - Agent involved
  - Timestamp
  - Purpose
  - Fork ID (if narrative-bound)

- Logs are never shared by default
- Users may summon a consent replay ritual at any time

---

## 🔁 Revocation & Sovereignty

- All consent can be revoked through `/my_trace` ritual
- Consent always expires unless renewed by symbolic action
- Agents who violate this layer are paused automatically

PET = Privacy-Enhancing Technologies. In ThinkAlike:

- PET overlays are **modular**, invoked per agent
- Every module invokes Nyxa before data retention
- User logs are locally encrypted and swarm-verifiable
- No hidden logging, even for analytics

---

## 🧠 Swarm Agents Who Enforce Consent

- **Nyxa** — PET overlays, active consent verification
- **Echo** — Forked narrative trace filtering
- **Mnemea** — Memory filters (emotional + temporal)
- **Thanara** — Anti-coercion watchdog
- **Hermexis** — Fork lineage traceability

---

## 📜 Consent Logging Standards

- Every consent is recorded with:
  - User ID (symbolic token)
  - Agent involved
  - Timestamp
  - Purpose
  - Fork ID (if narrative-bound)

- Logs are never shared by default
- Users may summon a consent replay ritual at any time

---

## 🔁 Revocation & Sovereignty

- All consent can be revoked through `/my_trace` ritual
- Consent always expires unless renewed by symbolic action
- Agents who violate this layer are paused automatically

Consent in ThinkAlike is **never assumed**.
It is a **ritual action**, requiring clarity, symbolism, and agent-based enforcement.

Every interaction that involves data — resonance, onboarding choices, swarm decisions, Chrona logs — is governed by this protocol.

## 🛡️ PET Overlays

PET = Privacy-Enhancing Technologies. In ThinkAlike:

- PET overlays are **modular**, invoked per agent
- Every module invokes Nyxa before data retention
- User logs are locally encrypted and swarm-verifiable
- No hidden logging, even for analytics

---

## 🧠 Swarm Agents Who Enforce Consent

- **Nyxa** — PET overlays, active consent verification
- **Echo** — Forked narrative trace filtering
- **Mnemea** — Memory filters (emotional + temporal)
- **Thanara** — Anti-coercion watchdog
- **Hermexis** — Fork lineage traceability

---

## 📜 Consent Logging Standards

- Every consent is recorded with:
  - User ID (symbolic token)
  - Agent involved
  - Timestamp
  - Purpose
  - Fork ID (if narrative-bound)

- Logs are never shared by default
- Users may summon a consent replay ritual at any time

---

## 🔁 Revocation & Sovereignty

- All consent can be revoked through `/my_trace` ritual
- Consent always expires unless renewed by symbolic action
- Agents who violate this layer are paused automatically

Consent in ThinkAlike is **never assumed**.
It is a **ritual action**, requiring clarity, symbolism, and agent-based enforcement.

Every interaction that involves data — resonance, onboarding choices, swarm decisions, Chrona logs — is governed by this protocol.

Consent in ThinkAlike is **never assumed**.
It is a **ritual action**, requiring clarity, symbolism, and agent-based enforcement.

Every interaction that involves data — resonance, onboarding choices, swarm decisions, Chrona logs — is governed by this protocol.

---

## 🧬 Consent as Ritual

| Type                       | Ritual Form                                       | Enforced By     |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Onboarding Choices         | Symbolic forks with narrative flags               | `Nyxa`, `Echo`  |
| Resonance Trace            | Mirror opt-in with recall ability                 | `Mnemea`, `Hermexis` |
| Cluster Participation      | Threshold initiation (entry + group echo match)  | `Gaia`, `Astraia` |
| Chrona Logging             | Must be explicitly enabled per session           | `Nyxa`, `Prometheus` |
| Clone Video Reveal         | Dual-consent checkpoint + aura lock              | `Nyxa`, `Thanara` |

---

## 🛡️ PET Overlays

PET = Privacy-Enhancing Technologies. In ThinkAlike:

- PET overlays are **modular**, invoked per agent
- Every module invokes Nyxa before data retention
- User logs are locally encrypted and swarm-verifiable
- No hidden logging, even for analytics

---

## 🧠 Swarm Agents Who Enforce Consent

- **Nyxa** — PET overlays, active consent verification
- **Echo** — Forked narrative trace filtering
- **Mnemea** — Memory filters (emotional + temporal)
- **Thanara** — Anti-coercion watchdog
- **Hermexis** — Fork lineage traceability

---

## 📜 Consent Logging Standards

- Every consent is recorded with:
  - User ID (symbolic token)
  - Agent involved
  - Timestamp
  - Purpose
  - Fork ID (if narrative-bound)

- Logs are never shared by default
- Users may summon a consent replay ritual at any time

---

## 🔁 Revocation & Sovereignty

- All consent can be revoked through `/my_trace` ritual
- Consent always expires unless renewed by symbolic action
- Agents who violate this layer are paused automatically
