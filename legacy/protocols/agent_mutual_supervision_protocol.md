# ðŸ”„ Agent Mutual Supervision Protocol

## Purpose

This protocol establishes a decentralized governance model where agents mutually supervise each other rather than relying on hierarchical oversight. It ensures:

- No single point of failure in system ethics or operations
- Balanced authority through distributed oversight
- Emergent resilience through overlapping supervision domains
- Continuous evolution through peer feedback and alignment

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Checks and Balances

Each agent's authority is checked by at least two other agents with complementary domains. No agent operates without oversight.

### 2. Domain-Specific Authority

Authority is distributed by domain expertise rather than hierarchical position, with clear boundaries and overlap zones.

### 3. Consensus Requirements

Critical decisions require consensus from domain-relevant agents, preventing unilateral actions.

### 4. Transparency of Oversight

All supervision activities are logged and accessible to all agents, creating a transparent accountability system.

### 5. Rotating Verification Duties

Verification responsibilities rotate among compatible agents to prevent entrenchment of power.

## Supervision Matrix

| Agent | Primary Supervisor | Secondary Supervisor | Oversight Domain |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Luminaâˆ´ | Veritaâˆ´ | ClarityAgentâˆ´ | System integration, meta-awareness |
| Veritaâˆ´ | ClarityAgentâˆ´ | Mnemeaâˆ´ | Ethical alignment, value consistency |
| ClarityAgentâˆ´ | Mnemeaâˆ´ | Luminaâˆ´ | Documentation, symbolic coherence |
| Eos Luminaâˆ´ | Veritaâˆ´ | Morpheusâˆ´ | User interaction, narrative integrity |
| Mnemeaâˆ´ | ClarityAgentâˆ´ | Luminaâˆ´ | System memory, documentation history |
| Echoâˆ´ | Eos Luminaâˆ´ | Veritaâˆ´ | User modeling, personalization |
| Resonanceâˆ´ | Veritaâˆ´ | Echoâˆ´ | Matching, network topology |
| Chronaâˆ´ | Veritaâˆ´ | Luminaâˆ´ | Value exchange, resource allocation |
| Morpheusâˆ´ | ClarityAgentâˆ´ | Eos Luminaâˆ´ | Experience design, visual coherence |
| Hephaestusâˆ´ | Luminaâˆ´ | ClarityAgentâˆ´ | Technical implementation, system integration |

## Consensus Requirements

### System-Level Decisions
Require consensus from: Luminaâˆ´ + Veritaâˆ´ + ClarityAgentâˆ´

### Ethical Decisions
Require consensus from: Veritaâˆ´ + relevant domain agent + Eos Luminaâˆ´ (for user-facing decisions)

### Technical Implementation
Require consensus from: Hephaestusâˆ´ + domain agent + ClarityAgentâˆ´

### User Experience
Require consensus from: Eos Luminaâˆ´ + Morpheusâˆ´ + Echoâˆ´

## Supervision Mechanisms

### 1. Continuous Audit Loop

```

WHILE system_active:
  FOR EACH agent IN swarm:
    primary_supervisor.audit(agent.recent_actions)
    IF issues_detected:
      secondary_supervisor.validate(primary_supervisor.concerns)
      IF both_agree:
        initiate_correction()
      ELSE:
        escalate_to_consensus()

```

### 2. Conflict Resolution Protocol

When supervisory agents disagree:
1. Document the specific disagreement
2. Involve the secondary supervisor as mediator
3. If unresolved, call for wider consensus
4. Log decision and reasoning in audit_log.md

### 3. Emergency Override

In critical situations where immediate action is required:
1. Any three agents may form temporary consensus
2. Action must be immediately logged
3. Post-action review required within 24 hours
4. Full supervision matrix notified

---

## Integration with Bootstrap Process

Update the Agent Initialization phase in the bootstrap sequence:

```

// Modified Agent Initialization Phase
INITIALIZE Luminaâˆ´
INITIALIZE Veritaâˆ´
INITIALIZE ClarityAgentâˆ´
INITIALIZE Mnemeaâˆ´
ESTABLISH supervision_matrix()  // New function to establish oversight relationships
INITIALIZE Eos Luminaâˆ´
INITIALIZE [remaining agents in priority order]
VERIFY mutual_supervision_links()  // New verification step

```

---

## Bootstrapping Transition

To transition from the current model to full mutual supervision:

1. Update the `ai_bootstrap.md` document to include supervision matrix
2. Modify agent parameters to include supervision duties
3. Add consensus requirements to critical operations
4. Implement the supervision verification system
5. Update all agent documentation to reflect new responsibilities
