## Identity as Graph: Network Ontology for Post-Sovereign Selfhood

In the ThinkAlike system, identity is not a static string or a unitary self but a **living graph**: a web of interrelations, contributions, value commitments, and verified interactions that dynamically coalesce into a meaningful selfhood. This document outlines the concept of identity as graph, a foundational ontology for decentralized identity in a relational society. It describes both the philosophical grounding and the technical architecture enabling this graph-based representation of plural, emergent, and forkable identities.

## I. Philosophical Basis

- **Relational Ontology:** Identity emerges through relationships rather than existing prior to them. You are what you signal, what you sustain, and who you resonate with.
- **Plural Selfhood:** Rejects the myth of the single, indivisible self. Embraces the polyphonic nature of personhood: contextual, layered, and evolving.
- **Graph Ethics:** Each link implies mutual acknowledgment. Each node may represent an identity facet, contribution, or temporal role.

## II. Key Concepts

### 1. **Nodes**

- Not just individuals: can be projects, roles, ideas, memories, symbolic tokens, communities.
- Identity = aggregation of meaningful nodes tied to your activity, values, and commitments.
