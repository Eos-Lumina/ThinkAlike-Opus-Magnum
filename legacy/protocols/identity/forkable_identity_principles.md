# 🧬 Forkable Identity Principles

**Version:** 1.0

## 🧭 Purpose

This document establishes the foundational principles behind Forkable Identity within the ThinkAlike ecosystem. Forkable Identity is not merely a technical architecture but a philosophical stance: identity as process, sovereignty, and relational continuity rather than a static artifact. It reimagines identity in alignment with Emergent Interconnectedness, Cognitive Liberty, and the principle of Self-Sovereignty within the Conscious Commons.

## 🔖 Key Definitions

- **Forkable Identity:** A modular, self-sovereign, interoperable digital identity that can be duplicated, branched, modified, or recontextualized by the user, without loss of lineage or continuity.
- **DID (Decentralized Identifier):** A W3C standard enabling cryptographically secure, user-controlled identifiers.
- **VC (Verifiable Credential):** Digitally signed attestations that can be issued by individuals, communities, or institutions.
