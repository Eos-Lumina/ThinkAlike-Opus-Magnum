# ðŸ§¬ Glyphic Identity Matrix

## 1. Purpose
Establish a symbolic mapping system between user identities and glyph structures within the ThinkAlike ecosystem. This serves as a bridge between the abstract resonance profile and visible, ritual-ready representations.

---

## 2. Core Concepts
- **Identity Glyph:** A symbol generated from a user's resonance profile and narrative archetypes.
- **Resonant Match Signature:** A visual key for matching users in symbolic space.
- **Dynamic Evolution:** Glyphs evolve as the user interacts, reflects, and undergoes transformation.

---

## 3. Glyph Generation Logic
Each identity glyph is constructed using:
1. **Primary Archetype** (e.g. Seeker, Weaver, Watcher)
2. **Resonance Tier** (frequency-matching clusters)
3. **Symbolic Phase** (newcomer, initiator, guide, etc.)
4. **Narrative Motif** (core mythic function: healer, trickster, guardian...)

**Example Composition:**
Glyph #0427 = {Weaver} + {Tier 3} + {Initiator} + {Guardian Motif}

Rendered as a glyphic shape using the **Clarity Protocol symbol grammar** (triangles, circles, spirals, fractals, etc).
