# Identity Governance Layer

## ðŸ§­ Purpose

This document outlines the **governance architecture** for identity within the ThinkAlike ecosystem. It establishes mechanisms for **credential issuance**, **fork validation**, **community verification**, and **collective resolution of identity conflicts** â€” all while upholding the principles of **cognitive liberty**, **ethical transparency**, and **post-national plurality**.

---

## ðŸ”’ Governance Principles

1. **Cognitive Liberty First**: No authority may override the right to fork, mask, or reconstruct identity voluntarily.
2. **Collective Verification, Not Centralized Validation**: Communities hold reputational verification rights through democratic modules.
3. **Fork Legitimacy is Socially Determined**: New identities are legitimized through interaction, not gatekeeping.
4. **Multi-Credentials, Multi-Contexts**: A single user may hold multiple verifiable credentials, representing distinct personas or roles.
5. **Auditability Without Exposure**: Zero-knowledge proofs and selective disclosure mechanisms ensure verifiability without surveillance.

|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Proof of Contribution** | Civic participation, code commits, knowledge uploads | DAO, Project        |
| **Resonance Verification** | Value alignment check-ins (semi-automated) | System + Peer Circle |
| **Reputation Tokens**     | Context-specific earned trust            | Liquid Peer Assembly |
| **Onboarding Completion** | Narrative walkthrough / initiation ritual passed | System              |
| **Community Credential**  | Accepted and trusted within specific circles or nodes | Community Nodes     |
