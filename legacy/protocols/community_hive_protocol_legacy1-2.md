## 🧭 Purpose

The Hive is ThinkAlike’s base governance engine — an opt-in space for symbolic coordination, fork voting, ritual co-creation, and certification. It merges Parecon, PET, and dream logic into scalable collaboration.

---

## 📦 Core Practices

- Fork Voting (no up/downvotes — symbolic alignment)
- Ritual Certification (see `e2.0_certification_process.md`)
- Timebank Exchange (Chrona ⧖ as coordination substrate)
- Swarm Agent Tasks (assignable via trust glyphs)

---

## 🔁 Sample Flow

1. A fork proposal is submitted to the Hive  
2. Contributors align through mirror or echo  
3. ClarityAgent evaluates PET constraints  
4. Badge + Chrona acknowledgment released

---

## 🔐 Consent

- Hive rituals are opt-in  
- Fork trails can be anonymized or burned  
- No required governance participation
