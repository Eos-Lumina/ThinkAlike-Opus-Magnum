# Narrative Duet Protocol

> **Purpose:** To define the structure, themes, mechanics, interaction flow, alignment assessment, and outcomes of the "Narrative Duet"—the symbolic, CYOA-style compatibility test at the heart of ThinkAlike’s connection process. This protocol is foundational for both the Portal Realm (first system-suggested match) and the Resonance Network Realm (user-initiated connections), ensuring all interactions are meaningful, ethical, and aligned with PET/Clarity and ThinkAlike’s symbolic/ritual standards.

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

The Narrative Duet is a symbolic, interactive narrative experience designed to test value alignment and compatibility between two users:
- **User A:** The active participant, seeking resonance.
- **User B:** Represented by their AI Clone, which embodies User B’s `UserValueProfile`, archetypes, and narrative history.

The Duet is used in:
- **Portal Realm:** As the first system-suggested match after the "Whispering Gallery" phase.
- **Resonance Network Realm:** For user-initiated connections after viewing another’s User Node and video.

The Narrative Duet moves beyond superficial profiles, fostering authentic connection through symbolic, narrative-driven interaction, always upholding PET/Clarity principles.

## 2. Initiation of a Narrative Duet

- **Portal Realm Context:**
  - Initiated after the "Whispering Gallery" phase.
  - User A interacts with an abstract, anonymized AI Clone of User B (User B is not present or notified unless a successful match occurs).
  - Eos Lumina∴ acts as facilitator and narrator.

- **Resonance Network Context:**
  - Initiated by User A after viewing User B’s video and User Node.
  - User B’s AI Clone participates; User B is notified only if a successful match occurs.
  - Eos Lumina∴ again facilitates the process.

---

## 3. Core Mechanics & Interaction Flow

- **CYOA Structure:**
  - The Duet is a branching narrative (Choose-Your-Own-Adventure) where User A makes choices at key junctures.
  - User B’s AI Clone responds, drawing on User B’s `UserValueProfile`, archetypes, and narrative history, ensuring the duet reflects User B’s actual resonant signature.
  - The story unfolds based on the interplay of choices, with Eos Lumina∴ providing narration, context, and symbolic cues.

- **Symbolic Language & Themes:**
  - Duets draw from ThinkAlike’s philosophical sources (`philosophical_sources.md`) and mythic index (`symbolic_myth_index.md`).
  - Themes include collaborative problem-solving, ethical dilemmas, co-creation of symbolic stories, and exploration of shared values.
  - Choices are designed to reveal compatibility on key values, epistemic modes (`epistemic_match_modes.md`), and narrative archetypes (`narrative_match_archetypes.md`).

## 4. Alignment Assessment

- **Alignment/Harmony:**
  - The system, guided by Eos Lumina∴, assesses the degree of alignment or harmony achieved during the Duet.
  - Assessment is based on congruence, complementarity, or constructive engagement between User A’s and User B’s AI Clone’s choices—not on "right/wrong" answers.
  - An internal `alignmentScore` is calculated for the session, drawing on the resonance of values, epistemic modes, and narrative archetypes.

## 5. Outcomes of a Narrative Duet

- **Sufficient Alignment (Successful Duet):**
  - Eos Lumina∴ narrates a harmonious conclusion.
  - Sequential, consensual reveal process:
    - **Portal:** User A consents to show their video. User B is notified, sees User A’s video, and consents to show theirs.
    - **Resonance Network:** User A confirms intent to connect. User B is notified, sees User A’s video, and consents.
  - Mutual reveal of User Nodes (identities).
  - Mutual opt-in for direct communication.
  - Resonance Network: Connection line is strengthened; positive signal for "Social LLM."

- **Insufficient Alignment (Unsuccessful Duet):**
  - Eos Lumina∴ narrates a gentle dissolution (e.g., "white light fade back to Eos Node" or node dimming in the Resonance Network).
  - No identities are revealed (if not already known).
  - No notification to User B (if not the initiator).
  - User A returns to Eos Lumina∴ (Portal) or browsing state (Resonance Network).
  - Resonance Network: Neutral or slightly corrective signal for that pairing in the "Social LLM."

---

## 6. Ethical Considerations & PET/Clarity

- **User Agency:** All choices are meaningful and have real impact on outcomes.
- **Transparency:** Eos Lumina∴ explains the purpose and mechanics of the Duet at the outset.
- **Consent:** Explicit, stepwise consent is required for any reveal of videos or identities, and for direct communication.
- **AI Clone Representation:** It is always clear that User B’s AI Clone is an AI based on User B’s profile, not User B in real-time.
- **Privacy:** No information is revealed to User B or others unless mutual consent is achieved.

> **Note:** This protocol is to be harmonized and iteratively refined in collaboration with domain experts, narrative designers, and the ThinkAlike community. All flows and mechanics must remain aligned with the Copilot Bootstrap & Alignment Guide and the project’s PET/Clarity and symbolic/ritual standards.
