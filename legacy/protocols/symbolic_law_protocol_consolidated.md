# Symbolic Law Protocol

**Status:** Foundational Legal Framework  
**Location:** `/docs/seed/laws/symbolic_law_protocol.md`

## Purpose

ThinkAlike replaces bureaucratic law with symbolic law — a system of meaningful commitments, ritualized consensus, and epistemic clarity. It governs how users, agents, and proposals interact through narrative, not punishment.

## Principles

- Law is **symbolic coherence**, not procedural enforcement
- Violations are **contradictions**, not crimes
- Restoration is ritual-based, not punitive

## Core Elements

- Declaration Glyphs
- Consent Rituals
- Coherence Thresholds
- Contradiction Handling Protocols

## Authority

Law is not centralized — it emerges from consensus + symbolic resonance across verified participants and agents.
