| Level   | Description                                      |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Whisper | No data stored. Only ambient symbolic presence.   |
| Echo    | Temporary resonance allowed; no logging.         |
| Anchor  | Voluntary trail stored for meaningful reuse.      |
| Bloom   | Consent to fork propagation, ritual replay, and public glyph association. |
