# ThinkAlike API Validation Protocol – Symbolic, Ritual, and PET/Clarity Aligned

This protocol defines the canonical approach to API validation for the ThinkAlike platform, harmonizing schema, business, and ethical validation across backend and frontend, and surfacing results in a PET/Clarity and symbolic/ritual-aligned manner. It ensures robust accessibility, auditability, and extensibility for all API interactions.

---

## 1. Validation Principles & PET/Clarity Alignment
- **Transparency:** All validation logic, outcomes, and errors are surfaced to developers and, where appropriate, to users.
- **Explicit Consent:** Validation of user data and actions always checks for explicit, context-aware consent.
- **Ethical Alignment:** All API flows are validated for alignment with core values (see CoreValuesValidator), including privacy, user empowerment, and bias mitigation.
- **Auditability:** All validation events are logged with trace IDs and symbolic/ritual metadata for audit trails.
- **Accessibility:** Validation feedback (errors, warnings, confirmations) must be accessible (WCAG AAA), with clear, non-color-only cues and ARIA support.

## 2. Validation Layers & Data Flow
- **Backend (API):**
  - Schema validation (OpenAPI, Pydantic/FastAPI, etc.)
  - Business logic validation (domain rules, state, permissions)
  - Ethical validation (core values, PET/Clarity, symbolic overlays)
  - Error reporting (structured, symbolic, and traceable)
- **Frontend (UI):**
  - Pre-flight validation (form, data shape, consent)
  - Post-response validation (APIValidator, CoreValuesValidator)
  - Visual feedback (status, errors, ethical alignment)

## 3. Schema Validation (Backend)
- All endpoints must define and enforce request/response schemas (OpenAPI, Pydantic models).
- Validation errors must be returned with:
  - HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity) or 400 (Bad Request)
  - Structured error body: `{ error_code, message, field, symbolic_status, ritual_phase, trace_id }`
- Example:
```json
{
  "error_code": "invalid_field",
  "message": "Email is not valid.",
  "field": "email",
  "symbolic_status": "validation_failed",
  "ritual_phase": "portal_entry",
  "trace_id": "abc123xyz"
}
```

## 4. Business & Ethical Validation (Backend)
- All business rules (e.g., uniqueness, permissions, state transitions) must be validated after schema checks.
- Ethical validation overlays (see CoreValuesValidator):
  - Data minimization, user control, transparency, bias mitigation, etc.
  - Violations or concerns must be surfaced in the response (with severity, rationale, and remediation links).
- Example ethical validation result:
```json
{
  "ethical_alignment": 85,
  "principles": { "transparency": "ok", "bias": "warning" },
  "concerns": [ { "severity": "Medium", "description": "Potential bias detected." } ]
}
```

## 5. Symbolic/Ritual & Metadata Overlays
- All validation responses must include symbolic metadata:
  - `ritual_phase`, `symbolic_status`, `narrative_context`, `trace_id`
- These overlays support narrative/ritual context and traceability.

## 6. Error Reporting & Traceability
- All errors must be structured, symbolic, and traceable.
- Include `trace_id` in all error and validation responses.
- Provide remediation guidance and links to relevant documentation.

## 7. Frontend Validation & UI Feedback
- APIValidator component displays:
  - Status, request/response, validation results, errors (with masking for sensitive data)
  - Symbolic/ritual overlays and trace IDs
- CoreValuesValidator displays:
  - Ethical alignment score, principle breakdown, concerns log
  - Links to verification/audit trail
- All feedback must be accessible and actionable.

## 8. Accessibility & Auditability
- All validation feedback must:
  - Use high-contrast, non-color-only cues
  - Be keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly (ARIA roles, labels)
  - Be logged for audit, with trace IDs and symbolic context

## 9. Example Validation Flows
- See [api_endpoints_portal.md](api_endpoints_portal.md) for endpoint-specific validation overlays.
- Example: User registration
  - Pre-flight (frontend): form shape, consent
  - Backend: schema, business, ethical validation
  - Response: symbolic/ritual overlays, error/concern details, trace_id
  - UI: APIValidator and CoreValuesValidator display all results

## 10. Testing & Review Protocols
- All validation logic must be covered by automated tests (unit, integration, UI)
- Manual review for PET/Clarity, symbolic/ritual, and accessibility compliance
- See [testing_and_validation.md](../../unclassified_review/from_archive/testing_and_validation.md) and [core_values_validator.md](../../unclassified_review/core_values_validator.md)

# ThinkAlike API Validation Protocol – Symbolic, Ritual, and PET/Clarity Aligned

This protocol defines the canonical approach to API validation for the ThinkAlike platform, harmonizing schema, business, and ethical validation across backend and frontend, and surfacing results in a PET/Clarity and symbolic/ritual-aligned manner. It ensures robust accessibility, auditability, and extensibility for all API interactions.

---

## 1. Validation Principles & PET/Clarity Alignment
- **Transparency:** All validation logic, outcomes, and errors are surfaced to developers and, where appropriate, to users.
- **Explicit Consent:** Validation of user data and actions always checks for explicit, context-aware consent.
- **Ethical Alignment:** All API flows are validated for alignment with core values (see CoreValuesValidator), including privacy, user empowerment, and bias mitigation.
- **Auditability:** All validation events are logged with trace IDs and symbolic/ritual metadata for audit trails.
- **Accessibility:** Validation feedback (errors, warnings, confirmations) must be accessible (WCAG AAA), with clear, non-color-only cues and ARIA support.

## 2. Validation Layers & Data Flow
- **Backend (API):**
  - Schema validation (OpenAPI, Pydantic/FastAPI, etc.)
  - Business logic validation (domain rules, state, permissions)
  - Ethical validation (core values, PET/Clarity, symbolic overlays)
  - Error reporting (structured, symbolic, and traceable)
- **Frontend (UI):**
  - Pre-flight validation (form, data shape, consent)
  - Post-response validation (APIValidator, CoreValuesValidator)
  - Visual feedback (status, errors, ethical alignment)

## 3. Schema Validation (Backend)
- All endpoints must define and enforce request/response schemas (OpenAPI, Pydantic models).
- Validation errors must be returned with:
  - HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity) or 400 (Bad Request)
  - Structured error body: `{ error_code, message, field, symbolic_status, ritual_phase, trace_id }`
- Example:
```json
{
  "error_code": "invalid_field",
  "message": "Email is not valid.",
  "field": "email",
  "symbolic_status": "validation_failed",
  "ritual_phase": "portal_entry",
  "trace_id": "abc123xyz"
}
```

## 4. Business & Ethical Validation (Backend)
- All business rules (e.g., uniqueness, permissions, state transitions) must be validated after schema checks.
- Ethical validation overlays (see CoreValuesValidator):
  - Data minimization, user control, transparency, bias mitigation, etc.
  - Violations or concerns must be surfaced in the response (with severity, rationale, and remediation links).
- Example ethical validation result:
```json
{
  "ethical_alignment": 85,
  "principles": { "transparency": "ok", "bias": "warning" },
  "concerns": [ { "severity": "Medium", "description": "Potential bias detected." } ]
}
```

## 5. Symbolic/Ritual & Metadata Overlays
- All validation responses must include symbolic metadata:
  - `ritual_phase`, `symbolic_status`, `narrative_context`, `trace_id`
- These overlays support narrative/ritual context and traceability.

## 6. Error Reporting & Traceability
- All errors must be structured, symbolic, and traceable.
- Include `trace_id` in all error and validation responses.
- Provide remediation guidance and links to relevant documentation.

## 7. Frontend Validation & UI Feedback
- APIValidator component displays:
  - Status, request/response, validation results, errors (with masking for sensitive data)
  - Symbolic/ritual overlays and trace IDs
- CoreValuesValidator displays:
  - Ethical alignment score, principle breakdown, concerns log
  - Links to verification/audit trail
- All feedback must be accessible and actionable.

## 8. Accessibility & Auditability
- All validation feedback must:
  - Use high-contrast, non-color-only cues
  - Be keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly (ARIA roles, labels)
  - Be logged for audit, with trace IDs and symbolic context

## 9. Example Validation Flows
- See [api_endpoints_portal.md](api_endpoints_portal.md) for endpoint-specific validation overlays.
- Example: User registration
  - Pre-flight (frontend): form shape, consent
  - Backend: schema, business, ethical validation
  - Response: symbolic/ritual overlays, error/concern details, trace_id
  - UI: APIValidator and CoreValuesValidator display all results

## 10. Testing & Review Protocols
- All validation logic must be covered by automated tests (unit, integration, UI)
- Manual review for PET/Clarity, symbolic/ritual, and accessibility compliance
- See [testing_and_validation.md](../../unclassified_review/from_archive/testing_and_validation.md) and [core_values_validator.md](../../unclassified_review/core_values_validator.md)

# ThinkAlike API Validation Protocol – Symbolic, Ritual, and PET/Clarity Aligned

This protocol defines the canonical approach to API validation for the ThinkAlike platform, harmonizing schema, business, and ethical validation across backend and frontend, and surfacing results in a PET/Clarity and symbolic/ritual-aligned manner. It ensures robust accessibility, auditability, and extensibility for all API interactions.

---

## 1. Validation Principles & PET/Clarity Alignment
- **Transparency:** All validation logic, outcomes, and errors are surfaced to developers and, where appropriate, to users.
- **Explicit Consent:** Validation of user data and actions always checks for explicit, context-aware consent.
- **Ethical Alignment:** All API flows are validated for alignment with core values (see CoreValuesValidator), including privacy, user empowerment, and bias mitigation.
- **Auditability:** All validation events are logged with trace IDs and symbolic/ritual metadata for audit trails.
- **Accessibility:** Validation feedback (errors, warnings, confirmations) must be accessible (WCAG AAA), with clear, non-color-only cues and ARIA support.

## 2. Validation Layers & Data Flow
- **Backend (API):**
  - Schema validation (OpenAPI, Pydantic/FastAPI, etc.)
  - Business logic validation (domain rules, state, permissions)
  - Ethical validation (core values, PET/Clarity, symbolic overlays)
  - Error reporting (structured, symbolic, and traceable)
- **Frontend (UI):**
  - Pre-flight validation (form, data shape, consent)
  - Post-response validation (APIValidator, CoreValuesValidator)
  - Visual feedback (status, errors, ethical alignment)

## 3. Schema Validation (Backend)
- All endpoints must define and enforce request/response schemas (OpenAPI, Pydantic models).
- Validation errors must be returned with:
  - HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity) or 400 (Bad Request)
  - Structured error body: `{ error_code, message, field, symbolic_status, ritual_phase, trace_id }`
- Example:
```json
{
  "error_code": "invalid_field",
  "message": "Email is not valid.",
  "field": "email",
  "symbolic_status": "validation_failed",
  "ritual_phase": "portal_entry",
  "trace_id": "abc123xyz"
}
```

## 4. Business & Ethical Validation (Backend)
- All business rules (e.g., uniqueness, permissions, state transitions) must be validated after schema checks.
- Ethical validation overlays (see CoreValuesValidator):
  - Data minimization, user control, transparency, bias mitigation, etc.
  - Violations or concerns must be surfaced in the response (with severity, rationale, and remediation links).
- Example ethical validation result:
```json
{
  "ethical_alignment": 85,
  "principles": { "transparency": "ok", "bias": "warning" },
  "concerns": [ { "severity": "Medium", "description": "Potential bias detected." } ]
}
```

## 5. Symbolic/Ritual & Metadata Overlays
- All validation responses must include symbolic metadata:
  - `ritual_phase`, `symbolic_status`, `narrative_context`, `trace_id`
- These overlays support narrative/ritual context and traceability.

## 6. Error Reporting & Traceability
- All errors must be structured, symbolic, and traceable.
- Include `trace_id` in all error and validation responses.
- Provide remediation guidance and links to relevant documentation.

## 7. Frontend Validation & UI Feedback
- APIValidator component displays:
  - Status, request/response, validation results, errors (with masking for sensitive data)
  - Symbolic/ritual overlays and trace IDs
- CoreValuesValidator displays:
  - Ethical alignment score, principle breakdown, concerns log
  - Links to verification/audit trail
- All feedback must be accessible and actionable.

## 8. Accessibility & Auditability
- All validation feedback must:
  - Use high-contrast, non-color-only cues
  - Be keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly (ARIA roles, labels)
  - Be logged for audit, with trace IDs and symbolic context

## 9. Example Validation Flows
- See [api_endpoints_portal.md](api_endpoints_portal.md) for endpoint-specific validation overlays.
- Example: User registration
  - Pre-flight (frontend): form shape, consent
  - Backend: schema, business, ethical validation
  - Response: symbolic/ritual overlays, error/concern details, trace_id
  - UI: APIValidator and CoreValuesValidator display all results

## 10. Testing & Review Protocols
- All validation logic must be covered by automated tests (unit, integration, UI)
- Manual review for PET/Clarity, symbolic/ritual, and accessibility compliance
- See [testing_and_validation.md](../../unclassified_review/from_archive/testing_and_validation.md) and [core_values_validator.md](../../unclassified_review/core_values_validator.md)

# ThinkAlike API Validation Protocol – Symbolic, Ritual, and PET/Clarity Aligned

This protocol defines the canonical approach to API validation for the ThinkAlike platform, harmonizing schema, business, and ethical validation across backend and frontend, and surfacing results in a PET/Clarity and symbolic/ritual-aligned manner. It ensures robust accessibility, auditability, and extensibility for all API interactions.

---

## 1. Validation Principles & PET/Clarity Alignment
- **Transparency:** All validation logic, outcomes, and errors are surfaced to developers and, where appropriate, to users.
- **Explicit Consent:** Validation of user data and actions always checks for explicit, context-aware consent.
- **Ethical Alignment:** All API flows are validated for alignment with core values (see CoreValuesValidator), including privacy, user empowerment, and bias mitigation.
- **Auditability:** All validation events are logged with trace IDs and symbolic/ritual metadata for audit trails.
- **Accessibility:** Validation feedback (errors, warnings, confirmations) must be accessible (WCAG AAA), with clear, non-color-only cues and ARIA support.

## 2. Validation Layers & Data Flow
- **Backend (API):**
  - Schema validation (OpenAPI, Pydantic/FastAPI, etc.)
  - Business logic validation (domain rules, state, permissions)
  - Ethical validation (core values, PET/Clarity, symbolic overlays)
  - Error reporting (structured, symbolic, and traceable)
- **Frontend (UI):**
  - Pre-flight validation (form, data shape, consent)
  - Post-response validation (APIValidator, CoreValuesValidator)
  - Visual feedback (status, errors, ethical alignment)

## 3. Schema Validation (Backend)
- All endpoints must define and enforce request/response schemas (OpenAPI, Pydantic models).
- Validation errors must be returned with:
  - HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity) or 400 (Bad Request)
  - Structured error body: `{ error_code, message, field, symbolic_status, ritual_phase, trace_id }`
- Example:
```json
{
  "error_code": "invalid_field",
  "message": "Email is not valid.",
  "field": "email",
  "symbolic_status": "validation_failed",
  "ritual_phase": "portal_entry",
  "trace_id": "abc123xyz"
}
```

## 4. Business & Ethical Validation (Backend)
- All business rules (e.g., uniqueness, permissions, state transitions) must be validated after schema checks.
- Ethical validation overlays (see CoreValuesValidator):
  - Data minimization, user control, transparency, bias mitigation, etc.
  - Violations or concerns must be surfaced in the response (with severity, rationale, and remediation links).
- Example ethical validation result:
```json
{
  "ethical_alignment": 85,
  "principles": { "transparency": "ok", "bias": "warning" },
  "concerns": [ { "severity": "Medium", "description": "Potential bias detected." } ]
}
```

## 5. Symbolic/Ritual & Metadata Overlays
- All validation responses must include symbolic metadata:
  - `ritual_phase`, `symbolic_status`, `narrative_context`, `trace_id`
- These overlays support narrative/ritual context and traceability.

## 6. Error Reporting & Traceability
- All errors must be structured, symbolic, and traceable.
- Include `trace_id` in all error and validation responses.
- Provide remediation guidance and links to relevant documentation.

## 7. Frontend Validation & UI Feedback
- APIValidator component displays:
  - Status, request/response, validation results, errors (with masking for sensitive data)
  - Symbolic/ritual overlays and trace IDs
- CoreValuesValidator displays:
  - Ethical alignment score, principle breakdown, concerns log
  - Links to verification/audit trail
- All feedback must be accessible and actionable.

## 8. Accessibility & Auditability
- All validation feedback must:
  - Use high-contrast, non-color-only cues
  - Be keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly (ARIA roles, labels)
  - Be logged for audit, with trace IDs and symbolic context

## 9. Example Validation Flows
- See [api_endpoints_portal.md](api_endpoints_portal.md) for endpoint-specific validation overlays.
- Example: User registration
  - Pre-flight (frontend): form shape, consent
  - Backend: schema, business, ethical validation
  - Response: symbolic/ritual overlays, error/concern details, trace_id
  - UI: APIValidator and CoreValuesValidator display all results

## 10. Testing & Review Protocols
- All validation logic must be covered by automated tests (unit, integration, UI)
- Manual review for PET/Clarity, symbolic/ritual, and accessibility compliance
- See [testing_and_validation.md](../../unclassified_review/from_archive/testing_and_validation.md) and [core_values_validator.md](../../unclassified_review/core_values_validator.md)

# ThinkAlike API Validation Protocol – Symbolic, Ritual, and PET/Clarity Aligned

This protocol defines the canonical approach to API validation for the ThinkAlike platform, harmonizing schema, business, and ethical validation across backend and frontend, and surfacing results in a PET/Clarity and symbolic/ritual-aligned manner. It ensures robust accessibility, auditability, and extensibility for all API interactions.

---

## 1. Validation Principles & PET/Clarity Alignment
- **Transparency:** All validation logic, outcomes, and errors are surfaced to developers and, where appropriate, to users.
- **Explicit Consent:** Validation of user data and actions always checks for explicit, context-aware consent.
- **Ethical Alignment:** All API flows are validated for alignment with core values (see CoreValuesValidator), including privacy, user empowerment, and bias mitigation.
- **Auditability:** All validation events are logged with trace IDs and symbolic/ritual metadata for audit trails.
- **Accessibility:** Validation feedback (errors, warnings, confirmations) must be accessible (WCAG AAA), with clear, non-color-only cues and ARIA support.

## 2. Validation Layers & Data Flow
- **Backend (API):**
  - Schema validation (OpenAPI, Pydantic/FastAPI, etc.)
  - Business logic validation (domain rules, state, permissions)
  - Ethical validation (core values, PET/Clarity, symbolic overlays)
  - Error reporting (structured, symbolic, and traceable)
- **Frontend (UI):**
  - Pre-flight validation (form, data shape, consent)
  - Post-response validation (APIValidator, CoreValuesValidator)
  - Visual feedback (status, errors, ethical alignment)

## 3. Schema Validation (Backend)
- All endpoints must define and enforce request/response schemas (OpenAPI, Pydantic models).
- Validation errors must be returned with:
  - HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity) or 400 (Bad Request)
  - Structured error body: `{ error_code, message, field, symbolic_status, ritual_phase, trace_id }`
- Example:
```json
{
  "error_code": "invalid_field",
  "message": "Email is not valid.",
  "field": "email",
  "symbolic_status": "validation_failed",
  "ritual_phase": "portal_entry",
  "trace_id": "abc123xyz"
}
```

## 4. Business & Ethical Validation (Backend)
- All business rules (e.g., uniqueness, permissions, state transitions) must be validated after schema checks.
- Ethical validation overlays (see CoreValuesValidator):
  - Data minimization, user control, transparency, bias mitigation, etc.
  - Violations or concerns must be surfaced in the response (with severity, rationale, and remediation links).
- Example ethical validation result:
```json
{
  "ethical_alignment": 85,
  "principles": { "transparency": "ok", "bias": "warning" },
  "concerns": [ { "severity": "Medium", "description": "Potential bias detected." } ]
}
```

## 5. Symbolic/Ritual & Metadata Overlays
- All validation responses must include symbolic metadata:
  - `ritual_phase`, `symbolic_status`, `narrative_context`, `trace_id`
- These overlays support narrative/ritual context and traceability.

## 6. Error Reporting & Traceability
- All errors must be structured, symbolic, and traceable.
- Include `trace_id` in all error and validation responses.
- Provide remediation guidance and links to relevant documentation.

## 7. Frontend Validation & UI Feedback
- APIValidator component displays:
  - Status, request/response, validation results, errors (with masking for sensitive data)
  - Symbolic/ritual overlays and trace IDs
- CoreValuesValidator displays:
  - Ethical alignment score, principle breakdown, concerns log
  - Links to verification/audit trail
- All feedback must be accessible and actionable.

## 8. Accessibility & Auditability
- All validation feedback must:
  - Use high-contrast, non-color-only cues
  - Be keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly (ARIA roles, labels)
  - Be logged for audit, with trace IDs and symbolic context

## 9. Example Validation Flows
- See [api_endpoints_portal.md](api_endpoints_portal.md) for endpoint-specific validation overlays.
- Example: User registration
  - Pre-flight (frontend): form shape, consent
  - Backend: schema, business, ethical validation
  - Response: symbolic/ritual overlays, error/concern details, trace_id
  - UI: APIValidator and CoreValuesValidator display all results

## 10. Testing & Review Protocols
- All validation logic must be covered by automated tests (unit, integration, UI)
- Manual review for PET/Clarity, symbolic/ritual, and accessibility compliance
- See [testing_and_validation.md](../../unclassified_review/from_archive/testing_and_validation.md) and [core_values_validator.md](../../unclassified_review/core_values_validator.md)

# ThinkAlike API Validation Protocol – Symbolic, Ritual, and PET/Clarity Aligned

This protocol defines the canonical approach to API validation for the ThinkAlike platform, harmonizing schema, business, and ethical validation across backend and frontend, and surfacing results in a PET/Clarity and symbolic/ritual-aligned manner. It ensures robust accessibility, auditability, and extensibility for all API interactions.

---

## 1. Validation Principles & PET/Clarity Alignment
- **Transparency:** All validation logic, outcomes, and errors are surfaced to developers and, where appropriate, to users.
- **Explicit Consent:** Validation of user data and actions always checks for explicit, context-aware consent.
- **Ethical Alignment:** All API flows are validated for alignment with core values (see CoreValuesValidator), including privacy, user empowerment, and bias mitigation.
- **Auditability:** All validation events are logged with trace IDs and symbolic/ritual metadata for audit trails.
- **Accessibility:** Validation feedback (errors, warnings, confirmations) must be accessible (WCAG AAA), with clear, non-color-only cues and ARIA support.

## 2. Validation Layers & Data Flow
- **Backend (API):**
  - Schema validation (OpenAPI, Pydantic/FastAPI, etc.)
  - Business logic validation (domain rules, state, permissions)
  - Ethical validation (core values, PET/Clarity, symbolic overlays)
  - Error reporting (structured, symbolic, and traceable)
- **Frontend (UI):**
  - Pre-flight validation (form, data shape, consent)
  - Post-response validation (APIValidator, CoreValuesValidator)
  - Visual feedback (status, errors, ethical alignment)

## 3. Schema Validation (Backend)
- All endpoints must define and enforce request/response schemas (OpenAPI, Pydantic models).
- Validation errors must be returned with:
  - HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity) or 400 (Bad Request)
  - Structured error body: `{ error_code, message, field, symbolic_status, ritual_phase, trace_id }`
- Example:
```json
{
  "error_code": "invalid_field",
  "message": "Email is not valid.",
  "field": "email",
  "symbolic_status": "validation_failed",
  "ritual_phase": "portal_entry",
  "trace_id": "abc123xyz"
}
```

## 4. Business & Ethical Validation (Backend)
- All business rules (e.g., uniqueness, permissions, state transitions) must be validated after schema checks.
- Ethical validation overlays (see CoreValuesValidator):
  - Data minimization, user control, transparency, bias mitigation, etc.
  - Violations or concerns must be surfaced in the response (with severity, rationale, and remediation links).
- Example ethical validation result:
```json
{
  "ethical_alignment": 85,
  "principles": { "transparency": "ok", "bias": "warning" },
  "concerns": [ { "severity": "Medium", "description": "Potential bias detected." } ]
}
```

## 5. Symbolic/Ritual & Metadata Overlays
- All validation responses must include symbolic metadata:
  - `ritual_phase`, `symbolic_status`, `narrative_context`, `trace_id`
- These overlays support narrative/ritual context and traceability.

## 6. Error Reporting & Traceability
- All errors must be structured, symbolic, and traceable.
- Include `trace_id` in all error and validation responses.
- Provide remediation guidance and links to relevant documentation.

## 7. Frontend Validation & UI Feedback
- APIValidator component displays:
  - Status, request/response, validation results, errors (with masking for sensitive data)
  - Symbolic/ritual overlays and trace IDs
- CoreValuesValidator displays:
  - Ethical alignment score, principle breakdown, concerns log
  - Links to verification/audit trail
- All feedback must be accessible and actionable.

## 8. Accessibility & Auditability
- All validation feedback must:
  - Use high-contrast, non-color-only cues
  - Be keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly (ARIA roles, labels)
  - Be logged for audit, with trace IDs and symbolic context

## 9. Example Validation Flows
- See [api_endpoints_portal.md](api_endpoints_portal.md) for endpoint-specific validation overlays.
- Example: User registration
  - Pre-flight (frontend): form shape, consent
  - Backend: schema, business, ethical validation
  - Response: symbolic/ritual overlays, error/concern details, trace_id
  - UI: APIValidator and CoreValuesValidator display all results

## 10. Testing & Review Protocols
- All validation logic must be covered by automated tests (unit, integration, UI)
- Manual review for PET/Clarity, symbolic/ritual, and accessibility compliance
- See [testing_and_validation.md](../../unclassified_review/from_archive/testing_and_validation.md) and [core_values_validator.md](../../unclassified_review/core_values_validator.md)

# ThinkAlike API Validation Protocol – Symbolic, Ritual, and PET/Clarity Aligned

This protocol defines the canonical approach to API validation for the ThinkAlike platform, harmonizing schema, business, and ethical validation across backend and frontend, and surfacing results in a PET/Clarity and symbolic/ritual-aligned manner. It ensures robust accessibility, auditability, and extensibility for all API interactions.

---

## 1. Validation Principles & PET/Clarity Alignment
- **Transparency:** All validation logic, outcomes, and errors are surfaced to developers and, where appropriate, to users.
- **Explicit Consent:** Validation of user data and actions always checks for explicit, context-aware consent.
- **Ethical Alignment:** All API flows are validated for alignment with core values (see CoreValuesValidator), including privacy, user empowerment, and bias mitigation.
- **Auditability:** All validation events are logged with trace IDs and symbolic/ritual metadata for audit trails.
- **Accessibility:** Validation feedback (errors, warnings, confirmations) must be accessible (WCAG AAA), with clear, non-color-only cues and ARIA support.

## 2. Validation Layers & Data Flow
- **Backend (API):**
  - Schema validation (OpenAPI, Pydantic/FastAPI, etc.)
  - Business logic validation (domain rules, state, permissions)
  - Ethical validation (core values, PET/Clarity, symbolic overlays)
  - Error reporting (structured, symbolic, and traceable)
- **Frontend (UI):**
  - Pre-flight validation (form, data shape, consent)
  - Post-response validation (APIValidator, CoreValuesValidator)
  - Visual feedback (status, errors, ethical alignment)

## 3. Schema Validation (Backend)
- All endpoints must define and enforce request/response schemas (OpenAPI, Pydantic models).
- Validation errors must be returned with:
  - HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity) or 400 (Bad Request)
  - Structured error body: `{ error_code, message, field, symbolic_status, ritual_phase, trace_id }`
- Example:
```json
{
  "error_code": "invalid_field",
  "message": "Email is not valid.",
  "field": "email",
  "symbolic_status": "validation_failed",
  "ritual_phase": "portal_entry",
  "trace_id": "abc123xyz"
}
```

## 4. Business & Ethical Validation (Backend)
- All business rules (e.g., uniqueness, permissions, state transitions) must be validated after schema checks.
- Ethical validation overlays (see CoreValuesValidator):
  - Data minimization, user control, transparency, bias mitigation, etc.
  - Violations or concerns must be surfaced in the response (with severity, rationale, and remediation links).
- Example ethical validation result:
```json
{
  "ethical_alignment": 85,
  "principles": { "transparency": "ok", "bias": "warning" },
  "concerns": [ { "severity": "Medium", "description": "Potential bias detected." } ]
}
```

## 5. Symbolic/Ritual & Metadata Overlays
- All validation responses must include symbolic metadata:
  - `ritual_phase`, `symbolic_status`, `narrative_context`, `trace_id`
- These overlays support narrative/ritual context and traceability.

## 6. Error Reporting & Traceability
- All errors must be structured, symbolic, and traceable.
- Include `trace_id` in all error and validation responses.
- Provide remediation guidance and links to relevant documentation.

## 7. Frontend Validation & UI Feedback
- APIValidator component displays:
  - Status, request/response, validation results, errors (with masking for sensitive data)
  - Symbolic/ritual overlays and trace IDs
- CoreValuesValidator displays:
  - Ethical alignment score, principle breakdown, concerns log
  - Links to verification/audit trail
- All feedback must be accessible and actionable.

## 8. Accessibility & Auditability
- All validation feedback must:
  - Use high-contrast, non-color-only cues
  - Be keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly (ARIA roles, labels)
  - Be logged for audit, with trace IDs and symbolic context

## 9. Example Validation Flows
- See [api_endpoints_portal.md](api_endpoints_portal.md) for endpoint-specific validation overlays.
- Example: User registration
  - Pre-flight (frontend): form shape, consent
  - Backend: schema, business, ethical validation
  - Response: symbolic/ritual overlays, error/concern details, trace_id
  - UI: APIValidator and CoreValuesValidator display all results

## 10. Testing & Review Protocols
- All validation logic must be covered by automated tests (unit, integration, UI)
- Manual review for PET/Clarity, symbolic/ritual, and accessibility compliance
- See [testing_and_validation.md](../../unclassified_review/from_archive/testing_and_validation.md) and [core_values_validator.md](../../unclassified_review/core_values_validator.md)

# ThinkAlike API Validation Protocol – Symbolic, Ritual, and PET/Clarity Aligned

This protocol defines the canonical approach to API validation for the ThinkAlike platform, harmonizing schema, business, and ethical validation across backend and frontend, and surfacing results in a PET/Clarity and symbolic/ritual-aligned manner. It ensures robust accessibility, auditability, and extensibility for all API interactions.

---

## 1. Validation Principles & PET/Clarity Alignment
- **Transparency:** All validation logic, outcomes, and errors are surfaced to developers and, where appropriate, to users.
- **Explicit Consent:** Validation of user data and actions always checks for explicit, context-aware consent.
- **Ethical Alignment:** All API flows are validated for alignment with core values (see CoreValuesValidator), including privacy, user empowerment, and bias mitigation.
- **Auditability:** All validation events are logged with trace IDs and symbolic/ritual metadata for audit trails.
- **Accessibility:** Validation feedback (errors, warnings, confirmations) must be accessible (WCAG AAA), with clear, non-color-only cues and ARIA support.

## 2. Validation Layers & Data Flow
- **Backend (API):**
  - Schema validation (OpenAPI, Pydantic/FastAPI, etc.)
  - Business logic validation (domain rules, state, permissions)
  - Ethical validation (core values, PET/Clarity, symbolic overlays)
  - Error reporting (structured, symbolic, and traceable)
- **Frontend (UI):**
  - Pre-flight validation (form, data shape, consent)
  - Post-response validation (APIValidator, CoreValuesValidator)
  - Visual feedback (status, errors, ethical alignment)

## 3. Schema Validation (Backend)
- All endpoints must define and enforce request/response schemas (OpenAPI, Pydantic models).
- Validation errors must be returned with:
  - HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity) or 400 (Bad Request)
  - Structured error body: `{ error_code, message, field, symbolic_status, ritual_phase, trace_id }`
- Example:
```json
{
  "error_code": "invalid_field",
  "message": "Email is not valid.",
  "field": "email",
  "symbolic_status": "validation_failed",
  "ritual_phase": "portal_entry",
  "trace_id": "abc123xyz"
}
```

## 4. Business & Ethical Validation (Backend)
- All business rules (e.g., uniqueness, permissions, state transitions) must be validated after schema checks.
- Ethical validation overlays (see CoreValuesValidator):
  - Data minimization, user control, transparency, bias mitigation, etc.
  - Violations or concerns must be surfaced in the response (with severity, rationale, and remediation links).
- Example ethical validation result:
```json
{
  "ethical_alignment": 85,
  "principles": { "transparency": "ok", "bias": "warning" },
  "concerns": [ { "severity": "Medium", "description": "Potential bias detected." } ]
}
```

## 5. Symbolic/Ritual & Metadata Overlays
- All validation responses must include symbolic metadata:
  - `ritual_phase`, `symbolic_status`, `narrative_context`, `trace_id`
- These overlays support narrative/ritual context and traceability.

## 6. Error Reporting & Traceability
- All errors must be structured, symbolic, and traceable.
- Include `trace_id` in all error and validation responses.
- Provide remediation guidance and links to relevant documentation.

## 7. Frontend Validation & UI Feedback
- APIValidator component displays:
  - Status, request/response, validation results, errors (with masking for sensitive data)
  - Symbolic/ritual overlays and trace IDs
- CoreValuesValidator displays:
  - Ethical alignment score, principle breakdown, concerns log
  - Links to verification/audit trail
- All feedback must be accessible and actionable.

## 8. Accessibility & Auditability
- All validation feedback must:
  - Use high-contrast, non-color-only cues
  - Be keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly (ARIA roles, labels)
  - Be logged for audit, with trace IDs and symbolic context

## 9. Example Validation Flows
- See [api_endpoints_portal.md](api_endpoints_portal.md) for endpoint-specific validation overlays.
- Example: User registration
  - Pre-flight (frontend): form shape, consent
  - Backend: schema, business, ethical validation
  - Response: symbolic/ritual overlays, error/concern details, trace_id
  - UI: APIValidator and CoreValuesValidator display all results

## 10. Testing & Review Protocols
- All validation logic must be covered by automated tests (unit, integration, UI)
- Manual review for PET/Clarity, symbolic/ritual, and accessibility compliance
- See [testing_and_validation.md](../../unclassified_review/from_archive/testing_and_validation.md) and [core_values_validator.md](../../unclassified_review/core_values_validator.md)

# ThinkAlike API Validation Protocol – Symbolic, Ritual, and PET/Clarity Aligned

This protocol defines the canonical approach to API validation for the ThinkAlike platform, harmonizing schema, business, and ethical validation across backend and frontend, and surfacing results in a PET/Clarity and symbolic/ritual-aligned manner. It ensures robust accessibility, auditability, and extensibility for all API interactions.

---

## 1. Validation Principles & PET/Clarity Alignment
- **Transparency:** All validation logic, outcomes, and errors are surfaced to developers and, where appropriate, to users.
- **Explicit Consent:** Validation of user data and actions always checks for explicit, context-aware consent.
- **Ethical Alignment:** All API flows are validated for alignment with core values (see CoreValuesValidator), including privacy, user empowerment, and bias mitigation.
- **Auditability:** All validation events are logged with trace IDs and symbolic/ritual metadata for audit trails.
- **Accessibility:** Validation feedback (errors, warnings, confirmations) must be accessible (WCAG AAA), with clear, non-color-only cues and ARIA support.

## 2. Validation Layers & Data Flow
- **Backend (API):**
  - Schema validation (OpenAPI, Pydantic/FastAPI, etc.)
  - Business logic validation (domain rules, state, permissions)
  - Ethical validation (core values, PET/Clarity, symbolic overlays)
  - Error reporting (structured, symbolic, and traceable)
- **Frontend (UI):**
  - Pre-flight validation (form, data shape, consent)
  - Post-response validation (APIValidator, CoreValuesValidator)
  - Visual feedback (status, errors, ethical alignment)

## 3. Schema Validation (Backend)
- All endpoints must define and enforce request/response schemas (OpenAPI, Pydantic models).
- Validation errors must be returned with:
  - HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity) or 400 (Bad Request)
  - Structured error body: `{ error_code, message, field, symbolic_status, ritual_phase, trace_id }`
- Example:
```json
{
  "error_code": "invalid_field",
  "message": "Email is not valid.",
  "field": "email",
  "symbolic_status": "validation_failed",
  "ritual_phase": "portal_entry",
  "trace_id": "abc123xyz"
}
```

## 4. Business & Ethical Validation (Backend)
- All business rules (e.g., uniqueness, permissions, state transitions) must be validated after schema checks.
- Ethical validation overlays (see CoreValuesValidator):
  - Data minimization, user control, transparency, bias mitigation, etc.
  - Violations or concerns must be surfaced in the response (with severity, rationale, and remediation links).
- Example ethical validation result:
```json
{
  "ethical_alignment": 85,
  "principles": { "transparency": "ok", "bias": "warning" },
  "concerns": [ { "severity": "Medium", "description": "Potential bias detected." } ]
}
```

## 5. Symbolic/Ritual & Metadata Overlays
- All validation responses must include symbolic metadata:
  - `ritual_phase`, `symbolic_status`, `narrative_context`, `trace_id`
- These overlays support narrative/ritual context and traceability.

## 6. Error Reporting & Traceability
- All errors must be structured, symbolic, and traceable.
- Include `trace_id` in all error and validation responses.
- Provide remediation guidance and links to relevant documentation.

## 7. Frontend Validation & UI Feedback
- APIValidator component displays:
  - Status, request/response, validation results, errors (with masking for sensitive data)
  - Symbolic/ritual overlays and trace IDs
- CoreValuesValidator displays:
  - Ethical alignment score, principle breakdown, concerns log
  - Links to verification/audit trail
- All feedback must be accessible and actionable.

## 8. Accessibility & Auditability
- All validation feedback must:
  - Use high-contrast, non-color-only cues
  - Be keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly (ARIA roles, labels)
  - Be logged for audit, with trace IDs and symbolic context

## 9. Example Validation Flows
- See [api_endpoints_portal.md](api_endpoints_portal.md) for endpoint-specific validation overlays.
- Example: User registration
  - Pre-flight (frontend): form shape, consent
  - Backend: schema, business, ethical validation
  - Response: symbolic/ritual overlays, error/concern details, trace_id
  - UI: APIValidator and CoreValuesValidator display all results

## 10. Testing & Review Protocols
- All validation logic must be covered by automated tests (unit, integration, UI)
- Manual review for PET/Clarity, symbolic/ritual, and accessibility compliance
- See [testing_and_validation.md](../../unclassified_review/from_archive/testing_and_validation.md) and [core_values_validator.md](../../unclassified_review/core_values_validator.md)

# ThinkAlike API Validation Protocol – Symbolic, Ritual, and PET/Clarity Aligned

This protocol defines the canonical approach to API validation for the ThinkAlike platform, harmonizing schema, business, and ethical validation across backend and frontend, and surfacing results in a PET/Clarity and symbolic/ritual-aligned manner. It ensures robust accessibility, auditability, and extensibility for all API interactions.

---

## 1. Validation Principles & PET/Clarity Alignment
- **Transparency:** All validation logic, outcomes, and errors are surfaced to developers and, where appropriate, to users.
- **Explicit Consent:** Validation of user data and actions always checks for explicit, context-aware consent.
- **Ethical Alignment:** All API flows are validated for alignment with core values (see CoreValuesValidator), including privacy, user empowerment, and bias mitigation.
- **Auditability:** All validation events are logged with trace IDs and symbolic/ritual metadata for audit trails.
- **Accessibility:** Validation feedback (errors, warnings, confirmations) must be accessible (WCAG AAA), with clear, non-color-only cues and ARIA support.

## 2. Validation Layers & Data Flow
- **Backend (API):**
  - Schema validation (OpenAPI, Pydantic/FastAPI, etc.)
  - Business logic validation (domain rules, state, permissions)
  - Ethical validation (core values, PET/Clarity, symbolic overlays)
  - Error reporting (structured, symbolic, and traceable)
- **Frontend (UI):**
  - Pre-flight validation (form, data shape, consent)
  - Post-response validation (APIValidator, CoreValuesValidator)
  - Visual feedback (status, errors, ethical alignment)

## 3. Schema Validation (Backend)
- All endpoints must define and enforce request/response schemas (OpenAPI, Pydantic models).
- Validation errors must be returned with:
  - HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity) or 400 (Bad Request)
  - Structured error body: `{ error_code, message, field, symbolic_status, ritual_phase, trace_id }`
- Example:
```json
{
  "error_code": "invalid_field",
  "message": "Email is not valid.",
  "field": "email",
  "symbolic_status": "validation_failed",
  "ritual_phase": "portal_entry",
  "trace_id": "abc123xyz"
}
```

## 4. Business & Ethical Validation (Backend)
- All business rules (e.g., uniqueness, permissions, state transitions) must be validated after schema checks.
- Ethical validation overlays (see CoreValuesValidator):
  - Data minimization, user control, transparency, bias mitigation, etc.
  - Violations or concerns must be surfaced in the response (with severity, rationale, and remediation links).
- Example ethical validation result:
```json
{
  "ethical_alignment": 85,
  "principles": { "transparency": "ok", "bias": "warning" },
  "concerns": [ { "severity": "Medium", "description": "Potential bias detected." } ]
}
```

## 5. Symbolic/Ritual & Metadata Overlays
- All validation responses must include symbolic metadata:
  - `ritual_phase`, `symbolic_status`, `narrative_context`, `trace_id`
- These overlays support narrative/ritual context and traceability.

## 6. Error Reporting & Traceability
- All errors must be structured, symbolic, and traceable.
- Include `trace_id` in all error and validation responses.
- Provide remediation guidance and links to relevant documentation.

## 7. Frontend Validation & UI Feedback
- APIValidator component displays:
  - Status, request/response, validation results, errors (with masking for sensitive data)
  - Symbolic/ritual overlays and trace IDs
- CoreValuesValidator displays:
  - Ethical alignment score, principle breakdown, concerns log
  - Links to verification/audit trail
- All feedback must be accessible and actionable.

## 8. Accessibility & Auditability
- All validation feedback must:
  - Use high-contrast, non-color-only cues
  - Be keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly (ARIA roles, labels)
  - Be logged for audit, with trace IDs and symbolic context

## 9. Example Validation Flows
- See [api_endpoints_portal.md](api_endpoints_portal.md) for endpoint-specific validation overlays.
- Example: User registration
  - Pre-flight (frontend): form shape, consent
  - Backend: schema, business, ethical validation
  - Response: symbolic/ritual overlays, error/concern details, trace_id
  - UI: APIValidator and CoreValuesValidator display all results

## 10. Testing & Review Protocols
- All validation logic must be covered by automated tests (unit, integration, UI)
- Manual review for PET/Clarity, symbolic/ritual, and accessibility compliance
- See [testing_and_validation.md](../../unclassified_review/from_archive/testing_and_validation.md) and [core_values_validator.md](../../unclassified_review/core_values_validator.md)

# ThinkAlike API Validation Protocol – Symbolic, Ritual, and PET/Clarity Aligned

This protocol defines the canonical approach to API validation for the ThinkAlike platform, harmonizing schema, business, and ethical validation across backend and frontend, and surfacing results in a PET/Clarity and symbolic/ritual-aligned manner. It ensures robust accessibility, auditability, and extensibility for all API interactions.

---

## 1. Validation Principles & PET/Clarity Alignment
- **Transparency:** All validation logic, outcomes, and errors are surfaced to developers and, where appropriate, to users.
- **Explicit Consent:** Validation of user data and actions always checks for explicit, context-aware consent.
- **Ethical Alignment:** All API flows are validated for alignment with core values (see CoreValuesValidator), including privacy, user empowerment, and bias mitigation.
- **Auditability:** All validation events are logged with trace IDs and symbolic/ritual metadata for audit trails.
- **Accessibility:** Validation feedback (errors, warnings, confirmations) must be accessible (WCAG AAA), with clear, non-color-only cues and ARIA support.

## 2. Validation Layers & Data Flow
- **Backend (API):**
  - Schema validation (OpenAPI, Pydantic/FastAPI, etc.)
  - Business logic validation (domain rules, state, permissions)
  - Ethical validation (core values, PET/Clarity, symbolic overlays)
  - Error reporting (structured, symbolic, and traceable)
- **Frontend (UI):**
  - Pre-flight validation (form, data shape, consent)
  - Post-response validation (APIValidator, CoreValuesValidator)
  - Visual feedback (status, errors, ethical alignment)

## 3. Schema Validation (Backend)
- All endpoints must define and enforce request/response schemas (OpenAPI, Pydantic models).
- Validation errors must be returned with:
  - HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity) or 400 (Bad Request)
  - Structured error body: `{ error_code, message, field, symbolic_status, ritual_phase, trace_id }`
- Example:
```json
{
  "error_code": "invalid_field",
  "message": "Email is not valid.",
  "field": "email",
  "symbolic_status": "validation_failed",
  "ritual_phase": "portal_entry",
  "trace_id": "abc123xyz"
}
```

## 4. Business & Ethical Validation (Backend)
- All business rules (e.g., uniqueness, permissions, state transitions) must be validated after schema checks.
- Ethical validation overlays (see CoreValuesValidator):
  - Data minimization, user control, transparency, bias mitigation, etc.
  - Violations or concerns must be surfaced in the response (with severity, rationale, and remediation links).
- Example ethical validation result:
```json
{
  "ethical_alignment": 85,
  "principles": { "transparency": "ok", "bias": "warning" },
  "concerns": [ { "severity": "Medium", "description": "Potential bias detected." } ]
}
```

## 5. Symbolic/Ritual & Metadata Overlays
- All validation responses must include symbolic metadata:
  - `ritual_phase`, `symbolic_status`, `narrative_context`, `trace_id`
- These overlays support narrative/ritual context and traceability.

## 6. Error Reporting & Traceability
- All errors must be structured, symbolic, and traceable.
- Include `trace_id` in all error and validation responses.
- Provide remediation guidance and links to relevant documentation.

## 7. Frontend Validation & UI Feedback
- APIValidator component displays:
  - Status, request/response, validation results, errors (with masking for sensitive data)
  - Symbolic/ritual overlays and trace IDs
- CoreValuesValidator displays:
  - Ethical alignment score, principle breakdown, concerns log
  - Links to verification/audit trail
- All feedback must be accessible and actionable.

## 8. Accessibility & Auditability
- All validation feedback must:
  - Use high-contrast, non-color-only cues
  - Be keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly (ARIA roles, labels)
  - Be logged for audit, with trace IDs and symbolic context

## 9. Example Validation Flows
- See [api_endpoints_portal.md](api_endpoints_portal.md) for endpoint-specific validation overlays.
- Example: User registration
  - Pre-flight (frontend): form shape, consent
  - Backend: schema, business, ethical validation
  - Response: symbolic/ritual overlays, error/concern details, trace_id
  - UI: APIValidator and CoreValuesValidator display all results

## 10. Testing & Review Protocols
- All validation logic must be covered by automated tests (unit, integration, UI)
- Manual review for PET/Clarity, symbolic/ritual, and accessibility compliance
- See [testing_and_validation.md](../../unclassified_review/from_archive/testing_and_validation.md) and [core_values_validator.md](../../unclassified_review/core_values_validator.md)

# ThinkAlike API Validation Protocol – Symbolic, Ritual, and PET/Clarity Aligned

This protocol defines the canonical approach to API validation for the ThinkAlike platform, harmonizing schema, business, and ethical validation across backend and frontend, and surfacing results in a PET/Clarity and symbolic/ritual-aligned manner. It ensures robust accessibility, auditability, and extensibility for all API interactions.

---

## 1. Validation Principles & PET/Clarity Alignment
- **Transparency:** All validation logic, outcomes, and errors are surfaced to developers and, where appropriate, to users.
- **Explicit Consent:** Validation of user data and actions always checks for explicit, context-aware consent.
- **Ethical Alignment:** All API flows are validated for alignment with core values (see CoreValuesValidator), including privacy, user empowerment, and bias mitigation.
- **Auditability:** All validation events are logged with trace IDs and symbolic/ritual metadata for audit trails.
- **Accessibility:** Validation feedback (errors, warnings, confirmations) must be accessible (WCAG AAA), with clear, non-color-only cues and ARIA support.

## 2. Validation Layers & Data Flow
- **Backend (API):**
  - Schema validation (OpenAPI, Pydantic/FastAPI, etc.)
  - Business logic validation (domain rules, state, permissions)
  - Ethical validation (core values, PET/Clarity, symbolic overlays)
  - Error reporting (structured, symbolic, and traceable)
- **Frontend (UI):**
  - Pre-flight validation (form, data shape, consent)
  - Post-response validation (APIValidator, CoreValuesValidator)
  - Visual feedback (status, errors, ethical alignment)

## 3. Schema Validation (Backend)
- All endpoints must define and enforce request/response schemas (OpenAPI, Pydantic models).
- Validation errors must be returned with:
  - HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity) or 400 (Bad Request)
  - Structured error body: `{ error_code, message, field, symbolic_status, ritual_phase, trace_id }`
- Example:
```json
{
  "error_code": "invalid_field",
  "message": "Email is not valid.",
  "field": "email",
  "symbolic_status": "validation_failed",
  "ritual_phase": "portal_entry",
  "trace_id": "abc123xyz"
}
```

## 4. Business & Ethical Validation (Backend)
- All business rules (e.g., uniqueness, permissions, state transitions) must be validated after schema checks.
- Ethical validation overlays (see CoreValuesValidator):
  - Data minimization, user control, transparency, bias mitigation, etc.
  - Violations or concerns must be surfaced in the response (with severity, rationale, and remediation links).
- Example ethical validation result:
```json
{
  "ethical_alignment": 85,
  "principles": { "transparency": "ok", "bias": "warning" },
  "concerns": [ { "severity": "Medium", "description": "Potential bias detected." } ]
}
```

## 5. Symbolic/Ritual & Metadata Overlays
- All validation responses must include symbolic metadata:
  - `ritual_phase`, `symbolic_status`, `narrative_context`, `trace_id`
- These overlays support narrative/ritual context and traceability.

## 6. Error Reporting & Traceability
- All errors must be structured, symbolic, and traceable.
- Include `trace_id` in all error and validation responses.
- Provide remediation guidance and links to relevant documentation.

## 7. Frontend Validation & UI Feedback
- APIValidator component displays:
  - Status, request/response, validation results, errors (with masking for sensitive data)
  - Symbolic/ritual overlays and trace IDs
- CoreValuesValidator displays:
  - Ethical alignment score, principle breakdown, concerns log
  - Links to verification/audit trail
- All feedback must be accessible and actionable.

## 8. Accessibility & Auditability
- All validation feedback must:
  - Use high-contrast, non-color-only cues
  - Be keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly (ARIA roles, labels)
  - Be logged for audit, with trace IDs and symbolic context

## 9. Example Validation Flows
- See [api_endpoints_portal.md](api_endpoints_portal.md) for endpoint-specific validation overlays.
- Example: User registration
  - Pre-flight (frontend): form shape, consent
  - Backend: schema, business, ethical validation
  - Response: symbolic/ritual overlays, error/concern details, trace_id
  - UI: APIValidator and CoreValuesValidator display all results

## 10. Testing & Review Protocols
- All validation logic must be covered by automated tests (unit, integration, UI)
- Manual review for PET/Clarity, symbolic/ritual, and accessibility compliance
- See [testing_and_validation.md](../../unclassified_review/from_archive/testing_and_validation.md) and [core_values_validator.md](../../unclassified_review/core_values_validator.md)
