# Ritual Temporality Engine

## Purpose

Models how rituals alter time perception, resonance accumulation, and symbolic memory flow in the Chrona system.

## Ritual Time Types

| Type               | Description                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Linear Ritual      | Sequential, time-anchored                   |
| Looping Ritual     | Recurs in cycles (e.g. lunar, solstice)     |
| Asynchronous Echo  | Fragments emerge across different users     |
| Transcendent Merge | Temporally fused symbolic experiences       |

## Time-Bending Properties

- Some rituals bend memory decay (freeze or amplify)
- Rituals may shift Chrona event causal weight
- Peak resonance moments “compress” time (higher symbolic intensity)
