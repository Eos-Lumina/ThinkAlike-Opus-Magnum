# 🔗 Resonance Matching Protocol

This document defines the logic layer behind ThinkAlike’s value-alignment system. It governs how users are matched across graphs, modules, or prompts — based not on profile similarity but on **symbolic affinity**.

## 🧭 Matching Principles

- **Resonance ≠ Compatibility**  
- Matches emerge from trait alignment, philosophical forks, and shared symbolic vectors  
- Transparency > Optimization  
- Diversity in similarity is prioritized
