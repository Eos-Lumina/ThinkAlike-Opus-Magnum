## Purpose

This index defines the working principles, style rules, naming conventions, and symbolic structure guidelines for contributing to the ThinkAlike documentation system.

---

## Working Rules

- **No numbered folders** — Structure must be symbolic and readable
- **Each folder must carry meaning** — No stubs or placeholders
- **All features must trace to a document** — No floating logic
- **No hallucinated documents** — All entries must emerge from validated design or recovered legacy

---

## Symbolic Style

- Use **ritual language** when appropriate (e.g., fork, mirror, convergence)
- Markdown formatting should emphasize **clarity, tone, and symbolic cadence**
- Frontmatter should follow a shared metadata schema (see `clarity_frontmatter_template.md`)

---

## Contributor Roles

- **System Meta-Agent**: Oversees coherence and truth alignment
- **Symbolic Librarian**: Manages document alignment to project narrative
- **Swarm Node**: Contributes from assigned perspective (e.g., ethics, overlays)
