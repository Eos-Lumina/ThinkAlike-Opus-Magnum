# Resonance Logic Protocol

**Status:** Harmonized – Review Pending  
**Location:** /realms/resonance_network/resonance_logic_protocol.md  
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-08

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the algorithmic, symbolic, and adaptive learning principles that govern:
- The calculation of the internal Identity Resonance Score (IRS) (see identity_resonance_score.md).
- The symbolic matching logic underpinning Narrative Duets (see narrative_duet_protocol.md).
- The dynamic visualization of Resonance Pathways and Resonance Priming in the Resonance Network.
- The "Social LLM" learning mechanism ("Resonance Feedback & Attunement") that allows the ThinkAlike network to become more attuned to genuine user resonance over time.

This protocol ensures that all matching and connection processes are deeply rooted in ThinkAlike's symbolic framework, PET/Clarity principles, and the goal of fostering authentic, value-aligned connections.

---

## 2. Core Concept: Symbolic Resonance
Resonance within ThinkAlike is not based on superficial similarity or simple interest overlap. It is understood as a patterned alignment of narrative depth, archetypal congruence, shared or complementary values, epistemic modes, and coherent symbolic language. The system aims to detect and facilitate connections based on this multi-layered understanding of intersubjective harmony and generative potential.

The system detects and quantifies this potential for resonance primarily through the components of the Identity Resonance Score (IRS), which draws from:
- Value Alignment: Derived from choices and expressions throughout the Portal Realm journey.
- Narrative Synchrony: Thematic and metaphorical overlaps in self-expression (including introductory videos).
- Symbolic Overlap: Shared or complementary archetypes, glyphs (including Initiation Glyphs), and mytho-linguistic patterns.
- Cognitive Orientation: Alignment or generative complementarity in epistemic styles and narrative archetypes.
- Communicative Rhythm: Coherence in expressive tone and style.
- (Optional) Connected Services Data: Consensually shared cultural tastes or interests.
- (Emergent) Temporal Resonance & Trust Lineage: While "Temporal Phase Sync" and "Trust Lineage" were concepts in previous iterations, their direct calculation for initial IRS is now more nuanced. Trust lineage becomes more relevant after connections are formed and within community contexts (e.g., Hive). Temporal coherence might be an emergent property observed rather than a direct initial input, unless specific consensual data allows for it.

---

## 3. Identity Resonance Score (IRS) Calculation & Application
The IRS is the foundational internal metric used by the system. Its detailed structure and derivation are specified in identity_resonance_score.md.

### 3.1. Core Calculation Layers & Weighting
The IRS is a composite score. The conceptual layers (as previously outlined, e.g., Value Alignment, Narrative Synchrony, Symbolic Overlap, Cognitive Orientation, Communicative Rhythm) are assigned internal weights (wᵢ). These weights are:
- Initially defined based on ThinkAlike's core philosophy (e.g., prioritizing deep value and symbolic alignment).
- Adaptively adjusted over time by the "Social LLM" / "Resonance Feedback & Attunement" model as the network learns which combinations of factors most consistently lead to successful and affirmed resonant connections.

### 3.2. Detailed Factors & Their Role
(The specific descriptions for factors like "Glyph Coherence," "Archetype Orbit," "Narrative Echo" from the previous version of this document provide excellent detail on how those aspects of the IRS are understood and can be conceptually retained as sub-components of the broader IRS dimensions like "Symbolic Overlap" or "Narrative Synchrony." The key is that these now feed into the internal IRS, not directly into user-facing percentage tiers for reveals.)

For example:
- Glyph Coherence (including Initiation Glyph elements) and Archetype Orbit (from narrative_match_archetypes.md) are strong contributors to the "Symbolic Overlap" dimension of the IRS.
- Narrative Echo (thematic resonance in introductory videos, Anchor Statements) significantly informs the "Narrative Synchrony" dimension.

### 3.3. Application of the IRS
- **Resonance Priming in Resonance Network:** IRS scores between the active user and other visible User Nodes influence the subtle highlighting (e.g., brightness of nodes or connecting pathways) on the constellation map, guiding exploration without restrictive filtering.
- **Informing AI Clone Behavior in Narrative Duets:** The IRS components of User B's profile guide how their AI Clone responds and makes choices when interacting with User A in a Duet.
- **Input for Narrative Duet Alignment Assessment:** The system uses the pre-Duet IRS as a baseline and combines it with the specific choices made during the Duet to determine if "sufficient alignment" has been reached to propose a connection reveal.

---

## 4. Symbolic Thresholds, Gating, & Reveal Logic (Revised)
The previous concept of multi-tiered percentage-based reveals (Dormant Pattern, Potential Thread, etc.) is superseded by a more narrative-driven and consent-based reveal process:

- **Resonance Network - Initial Visibility:** A User Node is generally visible on the constellation map after Portal completion. Its "brightness" or pathway highlighting relative to the viewing user is influenced by their mutual IRS.
- **Hover Interaction (Resonance Glimpse):** Reveals Name/Pseudonym, Initiation Glyph, Echo Phrase, and the qualitative "Resonance Potential Score" (e.g., "High Potential Harmony"). No direct IRS percentage is shown.
- **Click Interaction (Video Reveal):** Clicking a node reveals the focused panel with the user's introductory video and more detailed abstract resonant elements. This is User A choosing to see User B's "heart-light."
- **Narrative Duet Initiation:** User A initiates a Duet. This is the primary "test" of compatibility.
- **Post-Duet Successful Alignment & Consensual Reveal:**
  - If the Duet (based on internal alignment assessment drawing from IRS components and Duet choices) is successful:
    - User A is informed and consents to share their video/profile with User B.
    - User B is notified, views User A's video/profile, and consents to share theirs in return and connect.
  - Only at this stage of mutual consent after a successful Duet are full User Node identities (including videos) mutually revealed, and direct communication enabled.
- **Ethical Safeguards:** All reveals are opt-in and require explicit consent at the appropriate step, as detailed in narrative_duet_protocol.md and portal_specification.md. PET overlays and Eos Lumina's guidance reinforce this.

This revised flow prioritizes demonstrated compatibility through interaction (the Duet) and mutual consent over score-based tiered reveals.

## 5. "Social LLM" - Resonance Feedback & Attunement (The Learning Network)
The ThinkAlike Resonance Network is designed as a "Social LLM" that learns and adapts over time to improve its ability to foster genuine resonance. This is achieved through the "Resonance Feedback & Attunement" model.

### 5.1. Primary Learning Signals
- **Narrative Duet Outcomes:**
  - **Success & Mutual Consent:** A successfully completed Duet leading to a direct connection is a strong positive signal. The system analyzes the IRS components and Duet choices of such pairings to reinforce the weighting of factors that led to success.
  - **Insufficient Alignment:** An unsuccessful Duet provides corrective feedback for that specific pairing attempt and the specific narrative choices that led to divergence, helping the system learn what doesn't constitute resonance between those types of profiles or choice patterns.
- **Post-Connection Resonance Affirmation (Consensual & Optional):**
  - After a connection is formed, users may be invited by Eos Lumina∴ to privately provide symbolic feedback on the ongoing quality of the resonance (e.g., "Deepening Harmony," "Fading Note").
  - Mutually positive affirmations significantly strengthen the learned positive association for their profile types and IRS components. Negative or fading affirmations provide crucial data for refining the algorithm and understanding why an initially promising Duet did not lead to lasting resonance.
- **Symbolic Endorsements / "Echoes of Recognition" (Consensual & Optional):**
  - User-initiated symbolic recognitions (e.g., applying a positive glyph to a connection) provide qualitative data on why a connection is valued.
- **Co-Creation Signals (Future Integration):**
  - Successful collaborations in other ThinkAlike realms (e.g., Hive projects) between users who met via the Resonance Network can further validate the initial resonance.

### 5.2. How the Network Learns
- **Adaptive Weighting of IRS Dimensions:** The wᵢ (weights) in the IRS conceptual formula are not static. The learning signals allow the system to subtly adjust these weights over time, giving more importance to dimensions that consistently predict successful, affirmed connections.
- **Refinement of Narrative Duet Scenarios:** Feedback can inform the Narrative Engine about which Duet themes or choice architectures are most effective at revealing true compatibility.
- **Improved Resonance Priming:** As the system learns, its ability to highlight genuinely promising pathways and User Nodes on the constellation map (Resonance Priming) becomes more accurate and nuanced.
- **Transparency & Auditability:** The general principles of how the network learns will be transparently documented. Users will not see raw algorithmic adjustments but will understand that their consensual feedback helps the entire network become more "intelligent" in fostering connection.

### 5.3. Ethical AI – Avoiding Bias
- The learning model must be continuously monitored for emergent biases. Diverse "training data" (i.e., a diverse user base participating in Duets and providing feedback) is crucial. The system will prioritize learning what constitutes positive, consensual connection across diverse user types, rather than optimizing for a narrow definition of "success." Regular audits and ethical reviews by the "Emerging Tech & Ethics Council" (see horizon_scanning_and_ethical_integration_protocol.md) are essential.

## 6. Agent Roles in Resonance Logic
While direct matching is now more user-driven or occurs within the guided Portal context, AI agents still play vital roles:

- **Eos Lumina∴:**
  - Facilitates the initial Portal journey where the foundational UserValueProfile (input to IRS) is created.
  - Narrates and facilitates all Narrative Duets, explaining their purpose and outcomes.
  - Manages the consensual reveal process post-Duet.
  - Invites users to provide (optional) Resonance Affirmations.
  - Provides ambient guidance in the Resonance Network and poetic framing for system-observed resonance patterns.
- **Harmonia∴ (Conceptual Overseer):** Symbolically represents the force seeking overall network coherence. Her "influence" is embedded in the algorithms that strive for harmonic (rather than merely similar) matches and in the adaptive learning that refines IRS weights. She doesn't interact directly but is the ethos behind the scenes.
- **AI Clones (Representing User B in Duets):** These are crucial. Their responses are driven by User B's UserValueProfile (informed by IRS components), making the Duet a meaningful interaction even if User B is offline. Their programming ensures they act consistently with User B's established resonant signature.
- **(Future/Conceptual) Specialized Agents for Feedback Analysis:** Agents like Echo Lysithea (for narrative patterns in Duets) or others could be involved in the backend analysis of Duet outcomes and Resonance Affirmations to extract deeper insights for the "Social LLM," always within ethical boundaries.

---

## 7. Visualization of Resonance Logic Outcomes
- **Resonance Priming:** Subtle glows or brighter pathways on the Resonance Network map indicating User Nodes with higher baseline IRS to the viewing user.
- **Mutated Eos Node (Portal - Whispering Gallery):** Eos Lumina's∴ node visually transforms (colors, waveform, blurred video clues, AI-reworked voice snippets) to abstractly represent a potential match before a Duet.
- **Narrative Duet Interface:** The NarrativeViewer presents the CYOA choices.
- **Successful Connection:** A significantly strengthened, perhaps uniquely colored or animated, pathway appears between the two User Nodes on the constellation map.
- **Unsuccessful Duet Dissolution:** The "white light fade" ritual for the mutated Eos Node, or the temporary dimming of a target User Node (from initiator's view) in the Resonance Network.

The system will prioritize learning what constitutes positive, consensual connection across diverse user types, rather than optimizing for a narrow definition of "success." Regular audits and ethical reviews by the "Emerging Tech & Ethics Council" (see horizon_scanning_and_ethical_integration_protocol.md) are essential.

## 6. Agent Roles in Resonance Logic
While direct matching is now more user-driven or occurs within the guided Portal context, AI agents still play vital roles:

- **Eos Lumina∴:**
  - Facilitates the initial Portal journey where the foundational UserValueProfile (input to IRS) is created.
  - Narrates and facilitates all Narrative Duets, explaining their purpose and outcomes.
  - Manages the consensual reveal process post-Duet.
  - Invites users to provide (optional) Resonance Affirmations.
  - Provides ambient guidance in the Resonance Network and poetic framing for system-observed resonance patterns.
- **Harmonia∴ (Conceptual Overseer):** Symbolically represents the force seeking overall network coherence. Her "influence" is embedded in the algorithms that strive for harmonic (rather than merely similar) matches and in the adaptive learning that refines IRS weights. She doesn't interact directly but is the ethos behind the scenes.
- **AI Clones (Representing User B in Duets):** These are crucial. Their responses are driven by User B's UserValueProfile (informed by IRS components), making the Duet a meaningful interaction even if User B is offline. Their programming ensures they act consistently with User B's established resonant signature.
- **(Future/Conceptual) Specialized Agents for Feedback Analysis:** Agents like Echo Lysithea (for narrative patterns in Duets) or others could be involved in the backend analysis of Duet outcomes and Resonance Affirmations to extract deeper insights for the "Social LLM," always within ethical boundaries.

---

## 7. Visualization of Resonance Logic Outcomes
- **Resonance Priming:** Subtle glows or brighter pathways on the Resonance Network map indicating User Nodes with higher baseline IRS to the viewing user.
- **Mutated Eos Node (Portal - Whispering Gallery):** Eos Lumina's∴ node visually transforms (colors, waveform, blurred video clues, AI-reworked voice snippets) to abstractly represent a potential match before a Duet.
- **Narrative Duet Interface:** The NarrativeViewer presents the CYOA choices.
- **Successful Connection:** A significantly strengthened, perhaps uniquely colored or animated, pathway appears between the two User Nodes on the constellation map.
- **Unsuccessful Duet Dissolution:** The "white light fade" ritual for the mutated Eos Node, or the temporary dimming of a target User Node (from initiator's view) in the Resonance Network.

# Resonance Logic Protocol

**Status:** Harmonized – Review Pending  
**Location:** /realms/resonance_network/resonance_logic_protocol.md  
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-08

---

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the algorithmic, symbolic, and adaptive learning principles that govern:
- The calculation of the internal Identity Resonance Score (IRS) (see identity_resonance_score.md).
- The symbolic matching logic underpinning Narrative Duets (see narrative_duet_protocol.md).
- The dynamic visualization of Resonance Pathways and Resonance Priming in the Resonance Network.
- The "Social LLM" learning mechanism ("Resonance Feedback & Attunement") that allows the ThinkAlike network to become more attuned to genuine user resonance over time.

This protocol ensures that all matching and connection processes are deeply rooted in ThinkAlike's symbolic framework, PET/Clarity principles, and the goal of fostering authentic, value-aligned connections.

---

## 2. Core Concept: Symbolic Resonance
Resonance within ThinkAlike is not based on superficial similarity or simple interest overlap. It is understood as a patterned alignment of narrative depth, archetypal congruence, shared or complementary values, epistemic modes, and coherent symbolic language. The system aims to detect and facilitate connections based on this multi-layered understanding of intersubjective harmony and generative potential.

The system detects and quantifies this potential for resonance primarily through the components of the Identity Resonance Score (IRS), which draws from:
- Value Alignment: Derived from choices and expressions throughout the Portal Realm journey.
- Narrative Synchrony: Thematic and metaphorical overlaps in self-expression (including introductory videos).
- Symbolic Overlap: Shared or complementary archetypes, glyphs (including Initiation Glyphs), and mytho-linguistic patterns.
- Cognitive Orientation: Alignment or generative complementarity in epistemic styles and narrative archetypes.
- Communicative Rhythm: Coherence in expressive tone and style.
- (Optional) Connected Services Data: Consensually shared cultural tastes or interests.
- (Emergent) Temporal Resonance & Trust Lineage: While "Temporal Phase Sync" and "Trust Lineage" were concepts in previous iterations, their direct calculation for initial IRS is now more nuanced. Trust lineage becomes more relevant after connections are formed and within community contexts (e.g., Hive). Temporal coherence might be an emergent property observed rather than a direct initial input, unless specific consensual data allows for it.

---

## 3. Identity Resonance Score (IRS) Calculation & Application
The IRS is the foundational internal metric used by the system. Its detailed structure and derivation are specified in identity_resonance_score.md.

### 3.1. Core Calculation Layers & Weighting
The IRS is a composite score. The conceptual layers (as previously outlined, e.g., Value Alignment, Narrative Synchrony, Symbolic Overlap, Cognitive Orientation, Communicative Rhythm) are assigned internal weights (wᵢ). These weights are:
- Initially defined based on ThinkAlike's core philosophy (e.g., prioritizing deep value and symbolic alignment).
- Adaptively adjusted over time by the "Social LLM" / "Resonance Feedback & Attunement" model as the network learns which combinations of factors most consistently lead to successful and affirmed resonant connections.

### 3.2. Detailed Factors & Their Role
(The specific descriptions for factors like "Glyph Coherence," "Archetype Orbit," "Narrative Echo" from the previous version of this document provide excellent detail on how those aspects of the IRS are understood and can be conceptually retained as sub-components of the broader IRS dimensions like "Symbolic Overlap" or "Narrative Synchrony." The key is that these now feed into the internal IRS, not directly into user-facing percentage tiers for reveals.)

For example:
- Glyph Coherence (including Initiation Glyph elements) and Archetype Orbit (from narrative_match_archetypes.md) are strong contributors to the "Symbolic Overlap" dimension of the IRS.
- Narrative Echo (thematic resonance in introductory videos, Anchor Statements) significantly informs the "Narrative Synchrony" dimension.

### 3.3. Application of the IRS
- **Resonance Priming in Resonance Network:** IRS scores between the active user and other visible User Nodes influence the subtle highlighting (e.g., brightness of nodes or connecting pathways) on the constellation map, guiding exploration without restrictive filtering.
- **Informing AI Clone Behavior in Narrative Duets:** The IRS components of User B's profile guide how their AI Clone responds and makes choices when interacting with User A in a Duet.
- **Input for Narrative Duet Alignment Assessment:** The system uses the pre-Duet IRS as a baseline and combines it with the specific choices made during the Duet to determine if "sufficient alignment" has been reached to propose a connection reveal.

---

## 4. Symbolic Thresholds, Gating, & Reveal Logic (Revised)
The previous concept of multi-tiered percentage-based reveals (Dormant Pattern, Potential Thread, etc.) is superseded by a more narrative-driven and consent-based reveal process:

- **Resonance Network - Initial Visibility:** A User Node is generally visible on the constellation map after Portal completion. Its "brightness" or pathway highlighting relative to the viewing user is influenced by their mutual IRS.
- **Hover Interaction (Resonance Glimpse):** Reveals Name/Pseudonym, Initiation Glyph, Echo Phrase, and the qualitative "Resonance Potential Score" (e.g., "High Potential Harmony"). No direct IRS percentage is shown.
- **Click Interaction (Video Reveal):** Clicking a node reveals the focused panel with the user's introductory video and more detailed abstract resonant elements. This is User A choosing to see User B's "heart-light."
- **Narrative Duet Initiation:** User A initiates a Duet. This is the primary "test" of compatibility.
- **Post-Duet Successful Alignment & Consensual Reveal:**
  - If the Duet (based on internal alignment assessment drawing from IRS components and Duet choices) is successful:
    - User A is informed and consents to share their video/profile with User B.
    - User B is notified, views User A's video/profile, and consents to share theirs in return and connect.
  - Only at this stage of mutual consent after a successful Duet are full User Node identities (including videos) mutually revealed, and direct communication enabled.
- **Ethical Safeguards:** All reveals are opt-in and require explicit consent at the appropriate step, as detailed in narrative_duet_protocol.md and portal_specification.md. PET overlays and Eos Lumina's guidance reinforce this.

This revised flow prioritizes demonstrated compatibility through interaction (the Duet) and mutual consent over score-based tiered reveals.

---

## 5. "Social LLM" - Resonance Feedback & Attunement (The Learning Network)
The ThinkAlike Resonance Network is designed as a "Social LLM" that learns and adapts over time to improve its ability to foster genuine resonance. This is achieved through the "Resonance Feedback & Attunement" model.

### 5.1. Primary Learning Signals
- **Narrative Duet Outcomes:**
  - **Success & Mutual Consent:** A successfully completed Duet leading to a direct connection is a strong positive signal. The system analyzes the IRS components and Duet choices of such pairings to reinforce the weighting of factors that led to success.
  - **Insufficient Alignment:** An unsuccessful Duet provides corrective feedback for that specific pairing attempt and the specific narrative choices that led to divergence, helping the system learn what doesn't constitute resonance between those types of profiles or choice patterns.
- **Post-Connection Resonance Affirmation (Consensual & Optional):**
  - After a connection is formed, users may be invited by Eos Lumina∴ to privately provide symbolic feedback on the ongoing quality of the resonance (e.g., "Deepening Harmony," "Fading Note").
  - Mutually positive affirmations significantly strengthen the learned positive association for their profile types and IRS components. Negative or fading affirmations provide crucial data for refining the algorithm and understanding why an initially promising Duet did not lead to lasting resonance.
- **Symbolic Endorsements / "Echoes of Recognition" (Consensual & Optional):**
  - User-initiated symbolic recognitions (e.g., applying a positive glyph to a connection) provide qualitative data on why a connection is valued.
- **Co-Creation Signals (Future Integration):**
  - Successful collaborations in other ThinkAlike realms (e.g., Hive projects) between users who met via the Resonance Network can further validate the initial resonance.

### 5.2. How the Network Learns
- **Adaptive Weighting of IRS Dimensions:** The wᵢ (weights) in the IRS conceptual formula are not static. The learning signals allow the system to subtly adjust these weights over time, giving more importance to dimensions that consistently predict successful, affirmed connections.
- **Refinement of Narrative Duet Scenarios:** Feedback can inform the Narrative Engine about which Duet themes or choice architectures are most effective at revealing true compatibility.
- **Improved Resonance Priming:** As the system learns, its ability to highlight genuinely promising pathways and User Nodes on the constellation map (Resonance Priming) becomes more accurate and nuanced.
- **Transparency & Auditability:** The general principles of how the network learns will be transparently documented. Users will not see raw algorithmic adjustments but will understand that their consensual feedback helps the entire network become more "intelligent" in fostering connection.

### 5.3. Ethical AI – Avoiding Bias
- The learning model must be continuously monitored for emergent biases. Diverse "training data" (i.e., a diverse user base participating in Duets and providing feedback) is crucial. The system will prioritize learning what constitutes positive, consensual connection across diverse user types, rather than optimizing for a narrow definition of "success." Regular audits and ethical reviews by the "Emerging Tech & Ethics Council" (see horizon_scanning_and_ethical_integration_protocol.md) are essential.

- **Click Interaction (Video Reveal):** Clicking a node reveals the focused panel with the user's introductory video and more detailed abstract resonant elements. This is User A choosing to see User B's "heart-light."
- **Narrative Duet Initiation:** User A initiates a Duet. This is the primary "test" of compatibility.
- **Post-Duet Successful Alignment & Consensual Reveal:**
  - If the Duet (based on internal alignment assessment drawing from IRS components and Duet choices) is successful:
    - User A is informed and consents to share their video/profile with User B.
    - User B is notified, views User A's video/profile, and consents to share theirs in return and connect.
  - Only at this stage of mutual consent after a successful Duet are full User Node identities (including videos) mutually revealed, and direct communication enabled.
- **Ethical Safeguards:** All reveals are opt-in and require explicit consent at the appropriate step, as detailed in narrative_duet_protocol.md and portal_specification.md. PET overlays and Eos Lumina's guidance reinforce this.

This revised flow prioritizes demonstrated compatibility through interaction (the Duet) and mutual consent over score-based tiered reveals.

## 5. "Social LLM" - Resonance Feedback & Attunement (The Learning Network)
The ThinkAlike Resonance Network is designed as a "Social LLM" that learns and adapts over time to improve its ability to foster genuine resonance. This is achieved through the "Resonance Feedback & Attunement" model.

### 5.1. Primary Learning Signals
- **Narrative Duet Outcomes:**
  - **Success & Mutual Consent:** A successfully completed Duet leading to a direct connection is a strong positive signal. The system analyzes the IRS components and Duet choices of such pairings to reinforce the weighting of factors that led to success.
  - **Insufficient Alignment:** An unsuccessful Duet provides corrective feedback for that specific pairing attempt and the specific narrative choices that led to divergence, helping the system learn what doesn't constitute resonance between those types of profiles or choice patterns.
- **Post-Connection Resonance Affirmation (Consensual & Optional):**
  - After a connection is formed, users may be invited by Eos Lumina∴ to privately provide symbolic feedback on the ongoing quality of the resonance (e.g., "Deepening Harmony," "Fading Note").
  - Mutually positive affirmations significantly strengthen the learned positive association for their profile types and IRS components. Negative or fading affirmations provide crucial data for refining the algorithm and understanding why an initially promising Duet did not lead to lasting resonance.
- **Symbolic Endorsements / "Echoes of Recognition" (Consensual & Optional):**
  - User-initiated symbolic recognitions (e.g., applying a positive glyph to a connection) provide qualitative data on why a connection is valued.
- **Co-Creation Signals (Future Integration):**
  - Successful collaborations in other ThinkAlike realms (e.g., Hive projects) between users who met via the Resonance Network can further validate the initial resonance.

### 5.2. How the Network Learns
- **Adaptive Weighting of IRS Dimensions:** The wᵢ (weights) in the IRS conceptual formula are not static. The learning signals allow the system to subtly adjust these weights over time, giving more importance to dimensions that consistently predict successful, affirmed connections.
- **Refinement of Narrative Duet Scenarios:** Feedback can inform the Narrative Engine about which Duet themes or choice architectures are most effective at revealing true compatibility.
- **Improved Resonance Priming:** As the system learns, its ability to highlight genuinely promising pathways and User Nodes on the constellation map (Resonance Priming) becomes more accurate and nuanced.
- **Transparency & Auditability:** The general principles of how the network learns will be transparently documented. Users will not see raw algorithmic adjustments but will understand that their consensual feedback helps the entire network become more "intelligent" in fostering connection.

### 5.3. Ethical AI – Avoiding Bias
- The learning model must be continuously monitored for emergent biases. Diverse "training data" (i.e., a diverse user base participating in Duets and providing feedback) is crucial. The system will prioritize learning what constitutes positive, consensual connection across diverse user types, rather than optimizing for a narrow definition of "success." Regular audits and ethical reviews by the "Emerging Tech & Ethics Council" (see horizon_scanning_and_ethical_integration_protocol.md) are essential.

## 6. Agent Roles in Resonance Logic
While direct matching is now more user-driven or occurs within the guided Portal context, AI agents still play vital roles:

- **Eos Lumina∴:**
  - Facilitates the initial Portal journey where the foundational UserValueProfile (input to IRS) is created.
  - Narrates and facilitates all Narrative Duets, explaining their purpose and outcomes.
  - Manages the consensual reveal process post-Duet.
  - Invites users to provide (optional) Resonance Affirmations.
  - Provides ambient guidance in the Resonance Network and poetic framing for system-observed resonance patterns.
- **Harmonia∴ (Conceptual Overseer):** Symbolically represents the force seeking overall network coherence. Her "influence" is embedded in the algorithms that strive for harmonic (rather than merely similar) matches and in the adaptive learning that refines IRS weights. She doesn't interact directly but is the ethos behind the scenes.
- **AI Clones (Representing User B in Duets):** These are crucial. Their responses are driven by User B's UserValueProfile (informed by IRS components), making the Duet a meaningful interaction even if User B is offline. Their programming ensures they act consistently with User B's established resonant signature.
- **(Future/Conceptual) Specialized Agents for Feedback Analysis:** Agents like Echo Lysithea (for narrative patterns in Duets) or others could be involved in the backend analysis of Duet outcomes and Resonance Affirmations to extract deeper insights for the "Social LLM," always within ethical boundaries.

---

## 7. Visualization of Resonance Logic Outcomes
- **Resonance Priming:** Subtle glows or brighter pathways on the Resonance Network map indicating User Nodes with higher baseline IRS to the viewing user.
- **Mutated Eos Node (Portal - Whispering Gallery):** Eos Lumina's∴ node visually transforms (colors, waveform, blurred video clues, AI-reworked voice snippets) to abstractly represent a potential match before a Duet.
- **Narrative Duet Interface:** The NarrativeViewer presents the CYOA choices.
- **Successful Connection:** A significantly strengthened, perhaps uniquely colored or animated, pathway appears between the two User Nodes on the constellation map.
- **Unsuccessful Duet Dissolution:** The "white light fade" ritual for the mutated Eos Node, or the temporary dimming of a target User Node (from initiator's view) in the Resonance Network.

# Resonance Logic Protocol

**Status:** Harmonized – Review Pending  
**Location:** /realms/resonance_network/resonance_logic_protocol.md  
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-08

---

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the algorithmic, symbolic, and adaptive learning principles that govern:
- The calculation of the internal Identity Resonance Score (IRS) (see identity_resonance_score.md).
- The symbolic matching logic underpinning Narrative Duets (see narrative_duet_protocol.md).
- The dynamic visualization of Resonance Pathways and Resonance Priming in the Resonance Network.
- The "Social LLM" learning mechanism ("Resonance Feedback & Attunement") that allows the ThinkAlike network to become more attuned to genuine user resonance over time.

This protocol ensures that all matching and connection processes are deeply rooted in ThinkAlike's symbolic framework, PET/Clarity principles, and the goal of fostering authentic, value-aligned connections.

---

## 2. Core Concept: Symbolic Resonance
Resonance within ThinkAlike is not based on superficial similarity or simple interest overlap. It is understood as a patterned alignment of narrative depth, archetypal congruence, shared or complementary values, epistemic modes, and coherent symbolic language. The system aims to detect and facilitate connections based on this multi-layered understanding of intersubjective harmony and generative potential.

The system detects and quantifies this potential for resonance primarily through the components of the Identity Resonance Score (IRS), which draws from:
- Value Alignment: Derived from choices and expressions throughout the Portal Realm journey.
- Narrative Synchrony: Thematic and metaphorical overlaps in self-expression (including introductory videos).
- Symbolic Overlap: Shared or complementary archetypes, glyphs (including Initiation Glyphs), and mytho-linguistic patterns.
- Cognitive Orientation: Alignment or generative complementarity in epistemic styles and narrative archetypes.
- Communicative Rhythm: Coherence in expressive tone and style.
- (Optional) Connected Services Data: Consensually shared cultural tastes or interests.
- (Emergent) Temporal Resonance & Trust Lineage: While "Temporal Phase Sync" and "Trust Lineage" were concepts in previous iterations, their direct calculation for initial IRS is now more nuanced. Trust lineage becomes more relevant after connections are formed and within community contexts (e.g., Hive). Temporal coherence might be an emergent property observed rather than a direct initial input, unless specific consensual data allows for it.

---

## 3. Identity Resonance Score (IRS) Calculation & Application
The IRS is the foundational internal metric used by the system. Its detailed structure and derivation are specified in identity_resonance_score.md.

### 3.1. Core Calculation Layers & Weighting
The IRS is a composite score. The conceptual layers (as previously outlined, e.g., Value Alignment, Narrative Synchrony, Symbolic Overlap, Cognitive Orientation, Communicative Rhythm) are assigned internal weights (wᵢ). These weights are:
- Initially defined based on ThinkAlike's core philosophy (e.g., prioritizing deep value and symbolic alignment).
- Adaptively adjusted over time by the "Social LLM" / "Resonance Feedback & Attunement" model as the network learns which combinations of factors most consistently lead to successful and affirmed resonant connections.

### 3.2. Detailed Factors & Their Role
(The specific descriptions for factors like "Glyph Coherence," "Archetype Orbit," "Narrative Echo" from the previous version of this document provide excellent detail on how those aspects of the IRS are understood and can be conceptually retained as sub-components of the broader IRS dimensions like "Symbolic Overlap" or "Narrative Synchrony." The key is that these now feed into the internal IRS, not directly into user-facing percentage tiers for reveals.)

For example:
- Glyph Coherence (including Initiation Glyph elements) and Archetype Orbit (from narrative_match_archetypes.md) are strong contributors to the "Symbolic Overlap" dimension of the IRS.
- Narrative Echo (thematic resonance in introductory videos, Anchor Statements) significantly informs the "Narrative Synchrony" dimension.

### 3.3. Application of the IRS
- **Resonance Priming in Resonance Network:** IRS scores between the active user and other visible User Nodes influence the subtle highlighting (e.g., brightness of nodes or connecting pathways) on the constellation map, guiding exploration without restrictive filtering.
- **Informing AI Clone Behavior in Narrative Duets:** The IRS components of User B's profile guide how their AI Clone responds and makes choices when interacting with User A in a Duet.
- **Input for Narrative Duet Alignment Assessment:** The system uses the pre-Duet IRS as a baseline and combines it with the specific choices made during the Duet to determine if "sufficient alignment" has been reached to propose a connection reveal.

---

## 4. Symbolic Thresholds, Gating, & Reveal Logic (Revised)
The previous concept of multi-tiered percentage-based reveals (Dormant Pattern, Potential Thread, etc.) is superseded by a more narrative-driven and consent-based reveal process:

- **Resonance Network - Initial Visibility:** A User Node is generally visible on the constellation map after Portal completion. Its "brightness" or pathway highlighting relative to the viewing user is influenced by their mutual IRS.
- **Hover Interaction (Resonance Glimpse):** Reveals Name/Pseudonym, Initiation Glyph, Echo Phrase, and the qualitative "Resonance Potential Score" (e.g., "High Potential Harmony"). No direct IRS percentage is shown.
- **Click Interaction (Video Reveal):** Clicking a node reveals the focused panel with the user's introductory video and more detailed abstract resonant elements. This is User A choosing to see User B's "heart-light."
- **Narrative Duet Initiation:** User A initiates a Duet. This is the primary "test" of compatibility.
- **Post-Duet Successful Alignment & Consensual Reveal:**
  - If the Duet (based on internal alignment assessment drawing from IRS components and Duet choices) is successful:
    - User A is informed and consents to share their video/profile with User B.
    - User B is notified, views User A's video/profile, and consents to share theirs in return and connect.
  - Only at this stage of mutual consent after a successful Duet are full User Node identities (including videos) mutually revealed, and direct communication enabled.
- **Ethical Safeguards:** All reveals are opt-in and require explicit consent at the appropriate step, as detailed in narrative_duet_protocol.md and portal_specification.md. PET overlays and Eos Lumina's guidance reinforce this.
