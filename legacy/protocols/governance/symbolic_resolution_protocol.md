# Symbolic Resolution Protocol

## 1. Vision: Disputes as Mirrors, Not Scars

In ThinkAlike, conflict and contradiction are not failures to be punished, but opportunities for growth, reflection, and deeper understanding. Traditional systems of moderation and justice are often adversarial and punitive, leaving scars on the community fabric. This protocol establishes a new model where disputes become mirrors, reflecting underlying symbolic dissonances, which can then be harmonized through collective ritual and insight.

Rather than adversarial courts or moderation tools, ThinkAlike resolves tension through symbolic pattern recognition, agent-guided ritual, and swarm-based coherence feedback.

## 2. Core Principles

- **Restoration over Retribution:** The goal is always to restore harmony and understanding, not to assign blame or mete out punishment.
- **Symbolic Insight:** Conflicts are treated as symptoms of deeper symbolic or narrative misalignments.
- **Agent as Mediator:** Specialized agents act as neutral facilitators, guiding participants through the resolution process.
- **Transparency:** The process and its outcomes (stripped of private details) are recorded as a "reflective trail," serving as a learning resource for the entire community.

## 3. The Resolution Process

The protocol is invoked when a contradiction, dispute, or violation of another protocol is flagged by a user or agent.

1.  **Flagging & Triage:** A `ConflictFlag` is raised, containing details of the issue. An initial triage by a `GuardianAgent` determines if it's a simple misunderstanding or requires the full protocol.

2.  **Symbolic Analysis (The Echo Ritual):**
    *   A specialized `WeaverAgent` is assigned to the case.
    *   The agent performs an "Echo Ritual," retrieving the symbolic frames, narrative context, and value alignments of all involved parties from their `ValueProfile` and recent interactions.
    *   The agent analyzes this data to identify the core symbolic mismatch, distortion, or incoherence at the root of the conflict.

3.  **Guided Mediation (The Mirroring):**
    *   The `WeaverAgent` facilitates a mediated dialogue between the involved parties in a secure, private digital space.
    *   The agent "mirrors" its findings, presenting the symbolic dissonance to the participants not as accusation, but as a shared pattern to be understood.

4.  **Resolution Pathways:**
    Based on the dialogue, the agent proposes one or more pathways to resolution. The choice is consensual.
    *   **Integration:** The parties find a higher-order synthesis of their perspectives, creating a new, shared understanding. This is the most desired outcome.
    *   **Harmonious Divergence:** The parties agree to disagree, but with mutual understanding and respect for their differing perspectives. They may choose to limit future interactions.
    *   **Restorative Ritual:** If harm was done, the parties engage in a process defined by the [Restorative Justice Protocol](/protocols/governance/restorative_justice_protocol.md), which might involve apologies, acts of service, or other symbolic gestures of repair.
    *   **Ritual Retelling:** The story of the conflict and its resolution is anonymized and woven into the system's narrative layer, becoming a parable or lesson for the community.

## 4. The Output: A Reflective Trail

The outcome is never punitive. Instead, the protocol produces:

-   A **Reflective Trail:** A permanent, transparent record of the conflict and its resolution, accessible to the community for learning.
-   A **Ritual Memory Update:** The resolution is recorded in the `TraceabilityRecord` of the involved parties, often as a positive marker of growth and accountability.
-   A **System-Level Lesson:** The anonymized patterns from the conflict may be used to train agents, refine protocols, or improve community onboarding.

## 5. Escalation & Forking

If a resolution cannot be reached through this protocol, and the conflict represents a fundamental, irreconcilable schism in values or vision, the matter may be escalated. In the most extreme cases, this could serve as a trigger condition for the [Architecture Fork Protocol](/protocols/core/architecture_fork_protocol.md), allowing a segment of the community to diverge peacefully without destroying the original.
