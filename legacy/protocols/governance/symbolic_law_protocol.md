# Symbolic Law Protocol: The Covenant of Coherence

## 1. Purpose & Philosophical Foundation

ThinkAlike replaces bureaucratic law with **Symbolic Law**—a system of meaningful commitments, ritualized consensus, and epistemic clarity. It governs how users, agents, and proposals interact through shared narrative and symbolic acts, not through punitive enforcement. The goal is to maintain the coherence and integrity of the collective, not to punish dissent.

## 2. Core Principles

-   **Law as Symbolic Coherence:** Law is not a set of external rules to be followed, but a measure of the internal coherence and resonance of the system. Actions are evaluated based on whether they strengthen or weaken this coherence.
-   **Violations as Contradictions:** There are no "crimes," only "contradictions." A violation is an action or proposal that introduces a fundamental contradiction to the established principles and values of a collective.
-   **Restoration through Ritual:** The response to a contradiction is not punishment, but a ritual of restoration designed to resolve the dissonance and restore coherence, if possible.

## 3. Core Elements of Symbolic Law

-   **Declaration Glyphs:** Significant actions, proposals, or commitments must be accompanied by the invocation of a symbolic glyph. This act serves as a formal, public declaration of intent and binds the action to the symbolic record.
-   **Consent Rituals:** Meaningful consent is obtained through formal, interactive rituals, not by checking a box. These rituals ensure all parties fully understand the commitments being made.
-   **Coherence Thresholds:** Each collective defines its "coherence thresholds"—the fundamental principles that cannot be contradicted without threatening the identity of the group. These are encoded in their governance and founding documents.
-   **Contradiction Handling Protocols:** When a contradiction is detected, a specific protocol is invoked. This is not a trial, but a process of analysis, dialogue, and potential reconciliation or, if necessary, a ritual of separation (see `architecture_fork_protocol.md`).

## 4. Authority & Emergence

Legal authority is not centralized in a single entity. It **emerges from consensus and symbolic resonance** across verified participants and agents. A law is considered valid and binding when it achieves a critical mass of resonance within the relevant collective and is formally recorded in the symbolic registry.
