## üèõÔ∏è What Is the Sovereign Stack?

The **Sovereign Stack** defines a layered, interoperable architecture enabling individual and collective sovereignty in digital systems. It specifies how users, communities, and AI agents assert autonomy, control data, and co-create governance structures across decentralized platforms.

This stack is designed to be portable, forkable, and platform-agnostic ‚Äî usable within ThinkAlike and any future ethical digital commons infrastructure.

## üß± Layered Structure

### 1. **Identity Layer**

- Anchored by DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and VCs (Verifiable Credentials)
- Supports pseudonymity, multisig identities, forkable identity graphs
- Ties into Clarity Protocol and value profiles

### 2. **Agency Layer**

- Defines rights, roles, and capabilities
- Embeds AI agent delegation models and task autonomy
- Enables granular agency distribution (across humans, agents, collectives)

### 3. **Interaction Layer**

- Peer-to-peer encrypted communication (DMs, councils, threads)
- Secure reputation signaling and endorsements
- Contextual action logs and auditable histories

### 4. **Governance Layer**

- Liquid democracy, consensus protocols, local rulesets
- Plugin governance modules per collective
- Forkable constitutions and self-determined oversight structures

### 5. **Commons Layer**

- Knowledge, media, datasets governed as public goods
- Licensing, access, remix rights defined transparently
- Cross-compatible with ThinkAlike's Conscious Commons infrastructure

## üîí Principles

- **Non-Coercion:** Participation is always opt-in, data sovereignty is sacrosanct
- **Composability:** Stack layers can evolve independently or together
- **Portability:** Users can export full sovereign stack to compatible systems
- **Auditability:** Every transaction or decision path is cryptographically traceable
- **Forkability:** Users or collectives can fork and relaunch new sovereign stacks

## üåç Example in Use

A user creates a DID under ThinkAlike, establishes a value profile, and joins a self-governing project collective. Their contributions are tracked via VCs. Their AI agent "Voltaire" represents them in asynchronous deliberation. Their governance role includes vote delegation in the project‚Äôs council. Later, they fork to a new identity stack while retaining credentials and roles traceable to the original.

## ‚ú® Closing Note

Sovereignty in the digital realm is not achieved through withdrawal or opacity, but through radical transparency, modular autonomy, and auditable alignment. The Sovereign Stack Protocol formalizes this path ‚Äî not as static infrastructure, but as an evolving social code for conscious systems.
