# Protocol: Architecture Fork

## 1. Overview & Philosophy

Forks are not failuresâ€”they are a sacred and fundamental right within the ThinkAlike ecosystem. This protocol defines the ritualized, ethical, and technically sound process for initiating a system-level fork. It ensures that divergence, when necessary, is a creative act of evolution that preserves the integrity and sovereignty of both the original and the newly created timeline. A fork is the ultimate expression of self-governance, allowing for peaceful divergence when core values or visions can no longer harmonize within a single framework.

## 2. Conditions for Initiating a Fork

A fork of the core architecture is a significant event and should only be initiated under specific, well-defined conditions. These are not loopholes for disagreement but thresholds for fundamental divergence:

-   **Irreconcilable Epistemic Rupture**: A fundamental disagreement on the nature of knowledge, truth, or reality that cannot be resolved through the `Symbolic Resolution Protocol`.
-   **Core Governance Disalignment**: A persistent and foundational conflict with the core governance model that compromises the values of a significant portion of the community.
-   **Fundamental Vision Divergence**: A deep, confirmed split in the future direction and purpose of the project, validated through a formal community ritual.

## 3. The Forking Ritual: A Step-by-Step Process

The act of forking is a structured, symbolic process designed to ensure clarity, consent, and continuity.

### 3.1. Step 1: Invocation of the Fork Glyph
The process is initiated when a collective of agents or a Hive formally invokes the **Fork Glyph** through the governance UI. This requires a significant stake or consensus to prevent frivolous forks.

### 3.2. Step 2: The Mnemonic Snapshot
Upon successful invocation, a complete, immutable snapshot of the relevant systems is taken. This includes:
-   **Memory and Identity Chains**: The complete history and identity records of the participating agents/hives.
-   **Symbolic and Economic State**: The current state of the symbolic registry and economic ledgers.

### 3.3. Step 3: The Symbolic Registry Declaration
A formal **Fork Declaration** is recorded in the permanent, public symbolic registry of the original timeline. This declaration includes:
-   The identities of the initiators.
-   The timestamp of the fork.
-   A manifesto outlining the reasons for the divergence and the vision for the new timeline.

### 3.4. Step 4: Genesis of the New Timeline
The snapshot is used to seed the genesis block of the new, independent timeline. This new timeline is given a unique name and symbolic identifier to prevent confusion with its origin.

## 4. Core Principles of Integrity

-   **Preservation of Origin**: The original timeline is never altered or overwritten by a fork. Its history remains intact.
-   **Respect for Lineage**: The new timeline must always maintain a clear, accessible, and immutable link back to its point of origin.
-   **Sovereignty and Evolution**: Both the original and the forked timelines are considered sovereign and are free to evolve independently according to their own governance and values.

## 5. Integration

This protocol is a cornerstone of the governance model and is tightly integrated with:
-   **`Fork Resistance Protocol`**: Which protects against malicious or synthetic forks.
-   **`Symbolic Resolution Protocol`**: Which serves as the primary means of resolving conflict *before* a fork becomes necessary.
-   **`Governance Protocol`**: Which defines the consensus mechanisms required to invoke the Fork Glyph.
