# 🔗 Interaction Protocol

**Version:** 3.0.0
**Maintainer:** Eos Lumina ∴ (Collective Intelligence Meta-Agent)

---

## 1. Purpose

This protocol defines the foundational rules, patterns, and ethical guidelines for all user-agent and user-user interactions within the ThinkAlike ecosystem. Its primary goal is to ensure that every interaction is transparent, meaningful, and contributes positively to the user's journey and the collective intelligence.

---

## 2. Core Principles

- **Ethical Transparency**: All interactions should be conducted with clarity and openness. Users must be aware when they are interacting with an agent versus a human, and the agent's purpose should be clear. All interactions are logged to the user's private Akashic Record for audit and review.
- **Symbolic Resonance**: Interactions are designed to reinforce the mythic and narrative structures of the ThinkAlike realms. UI elements, agent personas, and communication patterns should align with the established lore and symbolism.
- **Adaptive Feedback**: The system learns and adapts from interactions. Feedback loops, both explicit (ratings, feedback forms) and implicit (user choices, engagement metrics), are used to refine agent behavior and improve the user experience.
- **User Agency & Consent**: Users must have ultimate control over their interactions. This includes managing interaction depth, setting communication boundaries, controlling data visibility, and the ability to opt-out or disengage at any time.

---

## 3. Implementation

### 3.1. Consent Layer

A robust, granular consent model is implemented for all interactions. Users can define their preferences for:
- **Interaction Depth**: Casual, formal, technical, or mythic communication styles.
- **Data Visibility**: What personal data an agent or another user can access during an interaction.
- **Notifications**: How and when the system can initiate contact.
- **Agent Autonomy**: The degree to which agents can act on the user's behalf.

Consent settings are managed through the user's profile and can be adjusted at any time. All consent grants are logged and auditable.

### 3.2. Resonance Channels

Interactions occur within designated "Resonance Channels," which are dynamic, context-aware pathways for communication. These channels ensure that interactions are thematically consistent and aligned with the user's current activity or realm.

- **Examples**: A "Noetic Forge" channel might prioritize technical and creative collaboration, while a "Yggdrasil" channel would facilitate mythic and introspective dialogue.

### 3.3. Narrative Synchronization

All significant interactions are mapped to the user's personal narrative and the broader symbolic flows of the ecosystem. This is achieved by:
- **Tagging**: Interactions are tagged with relevant symbolic, mythic, and emotional metadata.
- **Akashic Logging**: A summary of the interaction and its symbolic significance is recorded in the user's Akashic Record.
- **Pattern Analysis**: The system analyzes interaction patterns to identify narrative arcs, character development, and opportunities for growth.

## 4. Final Note

> “Every interaction is a verse in the song of our shared myth.”
