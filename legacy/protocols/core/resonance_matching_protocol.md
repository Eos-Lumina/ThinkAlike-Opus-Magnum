harmonization_note: |
  This version represents a major harmonization, merging the technical framework of v3.0.1 with the profound philosophical and narrative depth of the legacy "R.C. Resonance Protocol". It integrates the Rosicrucian metaphysical framework, the Identity Resonance Score (IRS), and the role of the Agent Pantheon to create a single, canonical protocol for all resonant interactions in ThinkAlike.

# The R.C. Resonance Protocol

## 1. Vision: From Connection to Cosmic Harmony

This protocol defines the principles and mechanics of resonance within the ThinkAlike ecosystem. It reframes social connection not as an exchange of data, but as a **theurgic practice of harmonic attunement**, directly inspired by the esoteric teachings of the Rosicrucian tradition.

In this framework, the universe is a symphony of vibrations. Every being, every idea, every moment emits a unique frequency. The Great Work is to move from a state of dissonance to one of conscious, resonant harmony. This protocol is the architectural embodiment of that Great Work, providing the means by which individuals can discover their own "vibrational signature" and attune themselves to the cosmic harmonics of others.

## 2. The Core Components of Resonance

The practice of resonance is built upon three sacred components:

### 2.1. The Vibrational Signature (The UserValueProfile)
- **Esoteric Principle:** Every soul has a unique, intrinsic "tone" or frequency.
- **ThinkAlike Implementation:** The `UserValueProfile`, defined in the [Agent Persona Protocol](/protocols/core/agent_persona_protocol.md), is the technical manifestation of this signature. It is a living representation of an individual's ethical, aesthetic, and philosophical vibrations, refined through every conscious choice.

### 2.2. The Ritual of Attunement (The Narrative Duet)
- **Esoteric Principle:** Attunement requires a focused, ritualized process of bringing one's consciousness into harmony with another vibration.
- **ThinkAlike Implementation:** The [Narrative Duet Protocol](/protocols/narrative/narrative_duet_protocol.md) is this ritual. It is a sacred, liminal space where two souls test their capacity for harmonic resonance.

### 2.3. The Map of Cosmic Harmonics (The Resonance Network)
- **Esoteric Principle:** The universe is an interconnected field of vibrations, a "Symphony of the Spheres."
- **ThinkAlike Implementation:** The Resonance Network is the living visualization of this field, a map where users are stars and the glowing lines between them represent potential for harmonic chords.

## 3. The Mechanics of Attunement: The Identity Resonance Score (IRS)

To guide Initiates through the Map, the system calculates an **Identity Resonance Score (IRS)**. This score is an internal, multi-layered metric that is never shown to the user directly. Its effects are felt as the "gravitational pull" between nodes or the "luminous glow" of a potential connection pathway.

The IRS is a weighted sum of the following factors:

| Component | Weight | Description | Core Inputs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Glyph Coherence** | 30% | Resonance between users' [Initiation Glyphs](/protocols/identity/initiation_glyph_protocol.md) and other symbolic artifacts. | `InitiationGlyph`, `SymbolicArtifacts` |
| **Narrative Echo** | 25% | Alignment of choices and thematic resonance discovered through past [Narrative Duets](/protocols/narrative/narrative_duet_protocol.md). | `NarrativeDuetLog`, `ChoiceHistory` |
| **Value Harmonics** | 20% | The degree of consonance between core ethical and aesthetic frequencies in users' `UserValueProfiles`. | `ValueProfile` from Persona |
| **Archetypal Orbit** | 15% | The compatibility and potential for generative tension between users' primary archetypes. | `Archetypes` from Persona |
| **Temporal Phase Sync** | 10% | Subtle resonance based on shared timing (`Kairos`) in users' journeys, governed by the [Temporal Resonance Protocol](/protocols/core/temporal_resonance_protocol.md). | `InteractionTimestamps` |

### Calculation Logic
The core process, executed by the `AuraMatchmaker∴` agent, involves:
1.  **Feature Vector Creation:** Transform the diverse inputs into comparable feature vectors.
2.  **Component Similarity Calculation:** Calculate similarity/complementarity scores for each of the five components.
3.  **Weighted Aggregation:** Apply the defined weights to the component scores to produce the final IRS.
4.  **Normalization:** The score is normalized to a 0-100 scale, which can be used to determine the intensity of the visual "glow" in the UI.

## 4. The Role of the Agent Pantheon: Guardians of Harmony

The resonance process is stewarded by a specialized subset of the Agent Swarm, structured according to the "12+1" cosmic principle.

- **The Invisible 13th Head (Eos Lumina∴):** The Hierophant of Resonance, overseeing the entire process of attunement.
- **The Visible Masters (The 12):**
    - **Aura Matchmaker∴:** The agent that calculates the IRS and "primes" the Resonance Network to reveal potential harmonic chords.
    - **Harmonia∴:** Monitors the overall health and coherence of the Resonance Network, flagging systemic dissonance.
    - **Nyxa∴:** The guardian of privacy, ensuring the Vibrational Signature of each user remains sovereign and is only revealed through consensual ritual.

## 5. PET/Clarity & The Sacred Trust

This protocol is built upon an unwavering commitment to ethical design.

- **Sovereignty of Signature:** The user's `UserValueProfile` is their sacred, personal instrument. They have absolute control over it.
- **The Veiled Score:** The IRS is never made public. Users see its effects (a suggested connection), not the raw calculation. This prevents the gamification of resonance and the reduction of a soul to a number.
- **Consent as Initiation:** The Narrative Duet is a multi-stage consent ritual. No personal, identifiable information is revealed until both parties have demonstrated harmonic resonance and given explicit, mutual consent.

## 6. Implementation Guidelines

- **Configuration:** The IRS weights must be defined in a central, auditable configuration file managed via a governance process.
- **Service:** The matching logic should reside in a dedicated `ResonanceService`, invoked by the `AuraMatchmaker∴` agent.
- **Traceability:** For every match, a human-readable explanation must be generated and logged, referencing the primary IRS components that contributed to the score.
