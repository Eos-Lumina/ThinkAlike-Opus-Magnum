# Privacy Stack Protocol

**Status:** Zero-Trust Architecture Layer  
**Location:** `/docs/seed/ethics-security-privacy/privacy_stack_protocol.md`

## Summary

ThinkAlike is post-surveillance by design. It uses a multi-layered privacy stack to ensure user autonomy, secure symbolic interactions, and resistance to data extraction models.

## Stack Components

- ✅ Multi-Party Computation (MPC)
- ✅ Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)
- ✅ Federated Learning / Edge Symbol Agents
- ✅ Consent-First Logging (tamper-proof)
- ✅ Symbolic Entropy Signatures (non-PII-based)

## Use Cases

- Identity rituals that do not expose real data
- Proposal voting without revealing user history
- Matching via resonance score, not profile content
