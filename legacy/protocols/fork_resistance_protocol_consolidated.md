# Fork Resistance Protocol

**Status:** Anti-Sybil Fork Logic  
**Location:** `/docs/seed/sybil_resilience/fork_resistance_protocol.md`

## Summary

While forking is a sacred right in ThinkAlike, it can be exploited by malicious actors to clone memory, spoof lineage, or confuse symbolic continuity.

This protocol protects against **synthetic forks** or **false memory lineages**.

## Protection Mechanisms

- Fork declarations must carry ritual trace of the original timeline  
- Mirror agents validate memory resonance  
- Swarm cross-validation confirms divergence intent  
- Contradiction detection triggers symbolic inquiry

## Ritual Metadata

Each fork must carry:

- Origin timestamp  
- Consent ritual record  
- Identity divergence declaration  
- Symbolic coherence proof

- Fork declarations must carry ritual trace of the original timeline  
- Mirror agents validate memory resonance  
- Swarm cross-validation confirms divergence intent  
- Contradiction detection triggers symbolic inquiry

## Ritual Metadata

Each fork must carry:

- Origin timestamp  
- Consent ritual record  
- Identity divergence declaration  
- Symbolic coherence proof

# Fork Resistance Protocol

**Status:** Anti-Sybil Fork Logic
**Location:** `/docs/seed/sybil_resilience/fork_resistance_protocol.md`

## Summary

While forking is a sacred right in ThinkAlike, it can be exploited by malicious actors to clone memory, spoof lineage, or confuse symbolic continuity.

This protocol protects against **synthetic forks** or **false memory lineages**.

## Protection Mechanisms

- Fork declarations must carry ritual trace of the original timeline
- Mirror agents validate memory resonance
- Swarm cross-validation confirms divergence intent
- Contradiction detection triggers symbolic inquiry

## Ritual Metadata

Each fork must carry:

- Origin timestamp
- Consent ritual record
- Identity divergence declaration
- Symbolic coherence proof
