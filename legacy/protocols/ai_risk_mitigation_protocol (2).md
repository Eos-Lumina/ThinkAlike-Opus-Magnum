# AI Risk Mitigation Protocol: A Framework for Ethical Foresight

## 1. Introduction & Sacred Intent: Warding Against Algorithmic Shadows
This protocol reframes AI risk mitigation as a proactive, sacred act of **Ethical Scrying**—warding against algorithmic shadows that may arise within the Alchemical Vessel of ThinkAlike. Its purpose is to ensure that AI serves as a catalyst for wisdom, connection, and empowerment, rather than harm.

## 2. The Ritualized Risk Lifecycle
The process unfolds in four ritual stages, guided by the Emerging Tech & Ethics Council:

1. **Divination (Risk Identification):**
   - Convene development teams and the Ethics Council for foresight workshops.
   - Catalog potential risks (ethical, social, privacy, security, symbolic).
2. **Augury (Risk Assessment):**
   - Evaluate each risk’s likelihood and impact (low/medium/high) using a symbolic matrix.
   - Prioritize risks that threaten user sovereignty or symbolic integrity.
3. **Warding (Mitigation Strategy):**
   - Define concrete safeguards: technical controls, PET/Clarity UI elements, agent directive updates, consent flows.
   - Document strategies in a formal Risk & Mitigation Assessment.
4. **Vigilance (Monitoring & Review):**
   - Track implemented mitigations via the AI Transparency Log and user feedback channels.
   - Conduct periodic reviews by the Ethics Council and update the protocol.

## 3. Integration with Governance & Allied Protocols
- The Emerging Tech & Ethics Council oversees all lifecycle stages.
- Risk & Mitigation Assessments are mandatory inputs for governance proposals in the Agora.
- Mitigation strategies must align with `src/swarm/unaligned/core/agent_alignment_directives.md` and be tested as per `ai_ethical_testing_guide.md`.

## 4. Practical Tools & Checklists

### Risk Assessment Matrix
| Risk Category               | Likelihood | Impact | Priority |
|-----------------------------|-----------:|-------:|---------:|
| Bias & Fairness             | Medium     | High   | High     |
| Transparency & Explainability| Medium    | Medium | Medium   |
| Privacy & Sovereignty       | Low        | High   | High     |
| Security & Integrity        | Medium     | High   | High     |
| Symbolic Integrity          | Low        | Medium | Medium   |
| Emergent/Systemic           | Low        | Low    | Low      |

### Common Risk Checklist
- Potential for emergent bias or echo chambers
- Risks of opaque or veiled decision-making
- Privacy violation or data misuse
- Adversarial or security vulnerabilities
- Symbolic misinterpretation or ritual desecration

## 5. Roles & Responsibilities
- **Emerging Tech & Ethics Council:** Oversight, formal approval, and periodic audits.
- **Ethical Guardian∴ / Themis∴:** AI-assisted monitoring and reporting.
- **Development Teams:** Implement and validate mitigation measures.
- **All Contributors:** Report new risks and participate in reviews.
