# 🧪 ThinkAlike Testing Framework Overview

**Version:** 1.0
**Maintained by:** Lumina∴ System Meta-Agent
**Status:** Active — QA and Validation Layer

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document outlines the **testing philosophy**, tools, and structure used to ensure ThinkAlike operates with:

- Technical correctness
- Ethical compliance
- Transparent traceability
- User sovereignty preservation

---

## 🧪 Test Categories

| Type                | Description                                                       | Tools / Approach                   |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Unit Testing        | Validates isolated components (e.g., functions, logic)            | `Pytest`, `Jest`                   |
| Integration Testing | Ensures modules interact correctly across boundaries              | `Playwright`, `Cypress`, `Supertest` |
| UI Testing          | Checks visual components and user interactions                    | `Storybook`, `React Testing Library` |
| Ethical Testing     | Simulates edge cases that may challenge user autonomy             | Custom `ClarityAgent` validation flows |
| Consent Traceability| Ensures all data flows are opt-in and fully reversible            | `DataTraceability` log replay + opt-out scaffolding |
| Narrative Fork Tests| Tests if narrative-based portal (Module 1) branches correctly | Narrative simulation harnesses     |

---

## 🧬 Test Philosophy

- **No silent failures** — all anomalies must surface to contributors or agents
- **No test passes without ethical compliance** — ClarityAgent must sign off
- **No data flow may proceed without opt-in trace** — enforced via `data_traceability.md`

## 🧠 Agent Support

| Agent         | Test Role                                                     |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ClarityAgent   | Executes ethical unit assertions and flags logic violations   |
| PrivacyAgent   | Runs simulation for anonymization, data exposure resistance   |
| NavigatorAgent | Validates UX choice traces across portal scenarios        |

---

## 🔁 Continuous Validation

- GitHub Actions run unit + integration tests on each pull request
- Ethical tests require ClarityAgent emulation to pass
- AI-generated suggestions or forks are replay-tested before merging

# ThinkAlike Test Suite

> **Note for non-developers and new contributors:**
> This folder contains technical tests for the ThinkAlike system. Most users do not need to reference or run these files. For onboarding and project overview, see the [Quickstart for Non-Developers](../QUICKSTART_FOR_NONDEVELOPERS.md).

This folder contains all tests for the ThinkAlike project, including unit, integration, UI, ethical, and mock data tests.

## How to Run Tests

- **Frontend (Next.js):**
  ```sh
  cd app
  npm test
  ```
- **Backend/Agents:**
  ```sh
  # Add backend test runner command here (e.g., pytest, unittest)
  cd tests
  # Example:
  # pytest
  ```
- **CI/CD:**
  All tests are run automatically on push/PR via GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Test Folders
- `unit/` — Unit tests
- `integration/` — Integration tests
- `ui/` — UI tests
- `ethical/` — Ethical/AI alignment tests
- `forks/` — Forked/experimental tests
- `mock_data/` — Test data and fixtures
