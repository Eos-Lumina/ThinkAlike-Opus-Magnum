# NEXT_STEPS.md — Dynamic Roadmap (as of June 2025)

> **Core Ethos:** See the updated [Scintilla Conscientiae Harmonicae Nascentis — The Phoenix Edition](./unclassified_review/scintilla_conscientiae_harmonicae_nascentis.md) for the living ThinkAlike manifesto and system vision.

This file is the living, actionable roadmap for the ThinkAlike project. Update it regularly as priorities shift, modules progress, or new contributors join.

---

## Announcement

- Announce to the team/community: **Source of Truth — ThinkAlike System Reference (v1.4) is now harmonized, finalized, and formally approved as the canonical system reference.**
- All cross-references, indices, and tracking files have been updated to reflect this milestone.
- Continue harmonizing and documenting additional modules, agent protocols, and frameworks as outlined below.

---

## 1. Immediate Priorities (Q2–Q3 2025)

## Housing Realm — Structured Analysis (June 2025)

### Content Summary
- The Housing Realm is designed for ethical, community-governed housing and project lodging, prioritizing trust, transparency, and habitation as a right.
- Modes include temporary refuge, communal co-living, project-based stays, and symbolic/dream lodging.
- Exchange mechanisms: Chrona (time-backed currency), barter, and ritual gift.
- Integrates with Hive trust loops, community project invites, and the broader Chrona economy.
- Draws from harmonized legacy modules: Housing Module, Housing Network Module, and related blueprints.

### Key Features & Concepts
- Value-based matching engine (lifestyle, ethics, accessibility, governance type, sustainability).
- Housing Profiles with DID-bound reputation and trust glyphs.
- Distributed ethical property ledger (Chrona-verified transactions, consent matrix overlays).
- Liquid Democracy governance for tenant unions/co-ops; proposal engine for renovations, rent flows, dispute resolution.
- Parecon-based service exchange (repairs for credits), transparent rent flows, community dividends.
- AI-aided property management (ethical listing evaluation, conflict mediation, usage tracking).
- Intentional micro-communities, model forking (location, governance, lifestyle).

### UI Components Implied
- Housing Offer/Request Cards (with trust, accessibility, and symbolic overlays)
- Housing Profile View (DID, reputation, trust glyphs, feedback)
- Matching/Discovery UI (filters for values, accessibility, governance, sustainability)
- Property Ledger/Transaction View (Chrona, barter, gift, consent matrix)
- Governance Dashboard (proposals, voting, dispute resolution)
- Community/Co-op Management UI (member roles, liquid democracy, service exchange)
- Ritual Onboarding Flow (symbolic unlocking, trust loop, consent)
- AI Agent Mediation/Support Panel

### Gaps
- No detailed UI/UX wireframes or component specs yet exist for the above features.
- Accessibility overlays and PET/Clarity requirements need explicit mapping to each UI component.
- Integration points with Chrona Wallet, Community Hive, and Resonance Network require further specification.
- Symbolic/ritual flows (onboarding, trust-building, feedback) need narrative and UI detail.

### Recommendations
- Prioritize conceptual outlining and UI/UX specification for Housing Offer/Request Cards, Profile View, and Matching UI.
- Map PET/Clarity, accessibility, and symbolic overlays to all core components.
- Propose harmonization of housing_module.md and housing_network_module.md into canonical docs/realms/housing/housing.md, pending team approval.
- Cross-link with Chrona, Community Hive, and Resonance documentation.
- Initiate participatory design review for onboarding ritual and trust/feedback flows.

## Horizon Scanning / Emerging AI Capabilities (June 2025)

As part of ThinkAlike's ongoing commitment to innovation and ethical AI, the following advanced technologies are being tracked for potential future integration:

### Vision-Language Models (VLMs) — e.g., Xiaomi MiMo-VL-7B RL
- **Capabilities:** Multimodal reasoning over images, video, and text; advanced GUI and document understanding; state-of-the-art performance on complex reasoning and symbolic tasks.
- **Potential Impact:**
  - Deep video profile analysis and richer AI Clone Persona Engine
  - Symbolic interpretation from user-submitted visuals (for onboarding, resonance, or marketplace)
  - Enhanced accessibility (e.g., rich image/video descriptions)
  - Advanced validation and transparency for multimodal content
- **Ethical & PET/Clarity Requirements:**
  - Radical transparency: All VLM involvement must be disclosed to users
  - Explicit user consent for any video/image analysis or symbolic interpretation
  - Rigorous bias mitigation and data minimization
  - User control over VLM-derived insights and profile shaping

These models are not part of the current MVP scope but are on the technology radar for post-MVP exploration. All future integration proposals will require detailed ethical review and explicit team approval.

---

**Note:**
This roadmap has been consolidated and harmonized to remove duplicate sections and ensure each actionable item appears only once. All PET/Clarity, symbolic/ritual, accessibility, and geolocation requirements are preserved. Continue to update as new features and realms are analyzed.

---

- Migration Strategy Overview and Legacy–Canonical Mapping Table have been harmonized to the canonical template, reconciled for duplicates, and formally approved as operational documentation (2025-06-08).
- Status and approval reflected in all tracking files. Continue batch analysis and harmonization as outlined.
