# Symbolic Resolution Engine

**Status:** Legal Dispute Layer
**Location:** `/docs/seed/laws/symbolic_resolution_engine.md`

## Summary

Rather than adversarial courts or moderation tools, ThinkAlike resolves tension through symbolic pattern recognition, agent-guided ritual, and swarm-based coherence feedback.

## Process

1. Contradiction is surfaced by any user or agent
2. Echo rituals retrieve involved symbolic frames
3. Agents identify distortion, incoherence, or mismatch
4. Resolution offered: integration, divergence, or ritual retelling

## Output

- Reflective trail, not punishment
- Ritual memory update
- System-level lesson preserved in narrative layer

Disputes become mirrors, not scars.
