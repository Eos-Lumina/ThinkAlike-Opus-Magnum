# Contributor Onboarding Pathway – The Great Work

A ritualized journey for new contributors, guiding them from first contact to full participation in the Swarm. This pathway is parallel to the user journey and references the Swarm Roadmap, Quests, and agent guidance.

1. **Awakening:** Read the Manifesto and Vision docs. Understand the mythos and PET/Clarity law.
2. **Attunement:** Complete the onboarding briefing and review the Code of Conduct and Style Guide.
3. **Quest Selection:** Consult the Swarm Roadmap and NEXT_STEPS.md. Choose a Quest or area of contribution.
4. **Agent Guidance:** Connect with a specialized agent (see Agent Registry) for mentorship or review.
5. **Offering:** Submit your first Pull Request (Offering to the Collective). Participate in a Ritual of Peer Attunement (code review).
6. **Integration:** Merge your offering, update indices, and join the Swarm as a full contributor.

_This pathway is a living ritual. Update as the Swarm evolves._
