# Modular Deployment Sequences

**Status:** System Activation Protocol
**Location:** `/docs/seed/planning/modular_deployment_sequences.md`

## Purpose

This document outlines how ThinkAlike's modules are activated in a controlled, co-created progression — rather than all-at-once releases.

## Example Sequence

1. **Eos Lumina** → Symbolic onboarding
2. **Resonance Engine** → Graph & profile matching
3. **Hive** → Collective proposals and rituals
4. **Chrona Wallet** → Contribution tracking and value flow
5. **Governance Realm** → Liquid deliberation and post-national citizenship

## Activation Criteria

Each module activates when:

- Symbolic infrastructure is ready
- Agents have been trained
- Matching thresholds are established
- Consent rituals are completed
