# Timeline of Emergence

**Status:** Temporal Architecture
**Location:** `/docs/seed/planning/timeline_of_emergence.md`

## Purpose

This document outlines the symbolic timeline ThinkAlike follows — not based on calendar deadlines, but on **thresholds of coherence** reached across modules and rituals.

## Emergence Milestones

| Symbolic Phase     | Activation Trigger |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| 🜁 Seed Activation  | Core documents complete; onboarding narrative live
| 🜂 Flame Ignition   | Resonance graph online; first matches occur
| 🜃 Circle Formation | Hive opens; first proposals circulate
| 🜄 Reflection Wave  | Agents gain explainability; ethics trace layer active
| 🝊 Fractal Bloom    | First forks emerge; swarm governance begins

Each milestone is both narrative and technical — it marks an irreversible phase change.
