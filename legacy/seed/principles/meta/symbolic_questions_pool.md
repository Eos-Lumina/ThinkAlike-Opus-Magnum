This document hosts the questions used to seed resonance mapping, fork triggers, and symbolic fingerprint construction during onboarding.

Each question is metaphorical, epistemic, and open-ended — designed not to extract data, but reveal alignment.

## 📖 Question Types

### 🕯️ Ethical Forks

* *What truth would you guard even if it unravels your name?*
* *Would you break your word to protect someone else's memory?*
* *Which principle would you abandon to remain human?*

### 🔍 Epistemic Mirrors

* *Do you believe all things can be known?*
* *Is contradiction a flaw or a pattern?*
* *Is a thought real if it has no language?*

### 🌀 Identity Symbols

* *Which of these are you most drawn to?*

  * *A lantern at the bottom of a well*
  * *A stairwell that turns back on itself*
  * *A map with only exit doors*

### 🌌 Resonance Projection

* *If someone dreams the same image as you, do they know you?*
* *When you are misunderstood, do you repeat or dissolve?*
* *Is knowing someone a form of touching them?*

## 🧠 Usage Logic

* Symbolic responses feed into `resonance_onboarding_variants.md`
* Certain answers flag branch switches, delays, or trigger ritual overlays
* Questions may be voiced by Eos Lumina, Lucia, or Kairos, depending on path

**Future Layering:**

* Variants by culture or semiotic background
* Temporal resonance drift: how answers change over time
* Symbolic weight scoring matrix
