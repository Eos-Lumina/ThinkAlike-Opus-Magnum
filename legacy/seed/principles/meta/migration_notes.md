## Purpose

This document records all major decisions, renamings, folder reorganizations, and file migrations throughout the ThinkAlike reconstruction process.

It ensures transparency, auditability, and recovery resilience across all future updates.

## Key Renaming Decisions

| Original                        | Renamed To                        | Rationale                                      |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `ai_modules/`                   | `swarm/`                          | Reflects poetic swarm architecture             |
| `onboarding/`                   | `portal/`                         | Symbolic entry; de-literalized folder name     |
| `academy_of_enlightenment/`     | `noetica/`                        | Aligned with knowledge-as-becoming philosophy  |
| `feature_document_matrix.md`   | `meta/veiled_matrix/veiled_matrix.md`                       | Cleaner, still semantically rich               |
| `prometheus_recovery_agent.md` | `phoenix_aeturnum.md`             | Aligned name with resurrection and singularity |

## Core Folder Stabilizations

- `identity_protocol/`, `symbolic_alignment/`, `resonance_mapping/`, `initiation_pathways/` → Fully populated, verified, and harmonized
- `realms/` renamed from modules; structure cleaned, crosslinked
- `/docs/seed/` verified as the root for system DNA and first principles

---

## Ongoing Streams

- **Legacy Archive Analysis**
  - Deep inspection of `archive.zip`, `bootstrap.zip`, chat logs
  - Extraction of symbolic agents, story fragments, and lost realms

- **Agent Recovery**
  - Hundreds of old agent files under triage
  - Solid names retained, duplicates purged
  - Swarm logic aligned with Enlightenment 2.0 ethics

- **Realm Naming Harmonization**
  - Clarified that **Chrona = currency**, not realm
  - Confirmed missing realms (jobs, housing, rituals) being reconstructed

---

## Fallback Instructions (In Case of Data Loss)

1. Recover `context_manifest.md` and `meta/veiled_matrix/veiled_matrix.md`
2. Use `docs/seed/` as symbolic system source
3. Activate `phoenix_aeturnum.md` (swarm recovery agent)
4. Re-fork project narrative using `thinkalike_system_narrative.md`
5. Review `migration_notes.md` and continue from last known sync
