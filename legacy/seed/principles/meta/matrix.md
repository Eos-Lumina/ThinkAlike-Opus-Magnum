# Matrix (Project Meta)

**This file is a stub and placeholder for the "Matrix" concept in ThinkAlike.**

- The Matrix is referenced throughout the project as a strategic, structural, or conceptual layer distinct from the Veiled Matrix.
- This file is not the Veiled Matrix. For the Veiled Matrix (decentralized strategic intelligence council), see:
  - [`docs/governance/veiled_matrix.md`](../../governance/veiled_matrix.md)
  - [`docs/seed/meta/veiled_matrix/veiled_matrix.md`](./veiled_matrix/veiled_matrix.md)
- For project status and component matrix, see:
  - [`docs/roadmap/project_status.md`](../../roadmap/project_status.md)
  - [`docs/roadmap/matrix.md`](../../roadmap/matrix.md)
- For onboarding and meta-structure, see:
  - [`docs/seed/meta/index.md`](./index.md)

*Update this file as the Matrix concept is further defined and harmonized.*
