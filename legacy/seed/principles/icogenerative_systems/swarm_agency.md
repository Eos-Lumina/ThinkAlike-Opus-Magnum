# Swarm Agency

**Status:** Active Protocol
**Location:** `/docs/seed/icogenerative_systems/swarm_agency.md`

## Overview

Swarm Agency is the cognitive scaffold that enables multiple AI agents and human contributors to co-create proposals, resolve complexity, and guide evolution. Each Swarm Agent is a symbolic participant â€” not just a tool.

## Key Functions

- Modular agent delegation (Navigator, Hive, Ritual, etc.)
- Transparent symbolic trace of each contribution
- Agent extensibility via JSON schemas
- Ethical override and consent infrastructure

## Principles

- Agents collaborate in reflective, mythic, and ritual modes.
- All actions are logged and reversible.
- No agent acts outside Enlightenment 2.0 constraints.
