# Ideation Flows

**Status:** Creative Engine Spec
**Location:** `/docs/seed/icogenerative_systems/ideation_flows.md`

## Purpose

This protocol governs how ideas are generated, nurtured, cross-linked, and elevated into proposals or rituals within the ThinkAlike system.

## Process Stages

1. **Prompt or seed input** (symbolic, narrative, data-based)
2. **Swarm reflection + divergence**
3. **Pattern clustering and resonance checks**
4. **Iterative refinement with agent/human feedback**
5. **Emergence of collective artifact (proposal, glyph, story)**

## Interfaces

- Hive proposal builder
- Ritual generation nodes
- Eos Lumina symbolic prompts
