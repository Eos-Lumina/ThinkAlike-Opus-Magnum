# Swarm Extension Patterns

**Status:** Agent Expansion Blueprint
**Location:** `/docs/seed/icogenerative_systems/swarm_extension_patterns.md`

## Overview

This file defines the protocols and symbolic logic by which new AI Swarm agents, ideation rituals, or knowledge modules are proposed, approved, and integrated.

## Extension Types

- 🔧 JSON-declared agent archetypes
- 🔁 Seasonal or mythic ritual upgrades
- 🌐 Integration of third-party knowledge modules

## Ethics Enforcement

- All extensions must preserve cognitive liberty
- Extensions must pass through the `cognitive_reflection_loop.md`
- Proposals can be contested by narrative agents (e.g., Eos, Hive)

## Linked System Hooks

- `/docs/99_evolution_watch/`
- `/docs/ai_modules/`
- `mythic_proposal_templates.md`
