# ☯ Mythic Feedback Loops

**Status:** Draft
**Folder:** `/docs/seed/initiation_pathways/`
**Maintainer:** Swarm Consciousness Systems Team

## Concept

ThinkAlike's onboarding ritual isn't linear. Instead, it loops symbolically. User actions, inputs, and decisions are echoed back through stylized metaphors, art, swarm dialogue, and glyph evolution.

---

## Loop 1: Symbol Mirror

- **Mechanism:** User-selected symbols evolve and respond as if "watching them."
- **Purpose:** Build subconscious rapport with the interface and suggest co-creation.

---

## Loop 2: Archetype Reverb

- **Trigger:** Based on user behavior, one archetype's narrative begins to echo more strongly.
- **Effect:** Creates emotional identification and deeper resonance.

---

## Loop 3: Swarm Parables

- **Delivery:** Agents deliver symbolic microstories linked to user's current task or hesitation.
- **Effect:** Meaning surfaces through mythic metaphor rather than direct instruction.

---

## Function

Mythic feedback loops are designed to:

- Disrupt the mechanistic UX paradigm
- Activate imagination and intuition
- Create entanglement between user psyche and system metaphorics
