# Overlay Fork Architecture

**Status:** Symbolic Continuity Logic
**Location:** `/docs/seed/overlays/overlay_fork_architecture.md`

## Purpose

When a fork occurs — narrative, proposal, or identity — the interface must reflect this transition not as rupture, but as symbolic divergence.

This file defines how overlays evolve across forks.

---

## Fork Overlay Logic

- **Shared Memory Layer**: Shows where overlay history is preserved
- **Resonance Drift Layer**: Visualizes divergence from prior symbolic attractors
- **Ritual Cut Point**: Marks exact symbolic event where fork occurred
- **Ghost Layer**: Optional glimpse into unfollowed branch UI state (ephemeral)

---

## Principles

- Forks are not errors. They are sacred transitions.
- UI must honor lineage, even when coherence diverges
- Each overlay becomes part of the user’s ritual memory map
