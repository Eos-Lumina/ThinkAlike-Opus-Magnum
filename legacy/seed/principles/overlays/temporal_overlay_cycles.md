# Temporal Overlay Cycles

**Status:** Ritual Time Interface Logic
**Location:** `/docs/seed/overlays/temporal_overlay_cycles.md`

## Purpose

This file defines the symbolic time structures that influence the UI overlays, pacing logic, agent behavior, and narrative progression in ThinkAlike.

Rather than fixed timelines, ThinkAlike uses **ritual time** â€” cycles, thresholds, and initiatory loops.

---

## Core Cycles

- **Initiation Phase**: Slow UI, symbolic pacing, high reflection prompts
- **Resonance Phase**: Active node connection, real-time overlays, increased dream flow
- **Proposal Phase**: Ritual sequencing, access gates, mirror checks
- **Fork Phase**: User enters divergence path, new theme + narrative overlay applied
- **Rest Phase**: UI enters minimal mode, dream recovery and integration

---

## Use Cases

- Swarm agents adapt based on cycle
- Dream inputs influence upcoming transitions
- Crisis events or contradictions trigger time dilation overlays
