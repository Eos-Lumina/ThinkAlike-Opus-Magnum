# Geospatial Overlay Patterns

**Status:** Map Resonance System
**Location:** `/docs/seed/overlays/geospatial_overlay_patterns.md`

## Purpose

This file defines how user location data (when opt-in) is overlaid with symbolic meaning, forming the **resonance constellation maps** that underpin ThinkAlikeâ€™s visual identity and interaction logic.

---

## Pattern Types

- **Constellation Mesh**: Nodes appear as light points; resonance forms visible lines
- **Dream Bloom Layer**: Regional overlay showing active dream motifs and emerging narratives
- **Civic Pulse Grid**: Intensity zones where proposals, rituals, or contradictions cluster
- **Temporal Spiral**: History of forked timelines and memory trails inscribed on place

---

## Consent Model

Geolocation overlays are opt-in only and **symbolically rendered**, never literal.
Users control how visible they are (e.g., shadow node, cryptic glyph, visible pulse).
