# Symbolic Overlay System

**Status:** Core Interface Logic
**Location:** `/docs/seed/overlays/symbolic_overlay_system.md`

## Purpose

In ThinkAlike, overlays are not visual skins — they are **symbolic interpretive layers** that change how data, interactions, and rituals are experienced.

Each overlay translates systemic structure into **metaphor, rhythm, and ritual logic**, aligned with the user’s symbolic profile and phase in the system.

---

## Types of Overlays

- **Geospatial**: Users appear as constellations, glyphs, or pulse lines on maps
- **Temporal**: Different “epochs” or system phases alter interface pacing and tone
- **Semantic**: UI vocabulary shifts based on narrative layer or agent mode
- **Mythic**: Archetypal overlays align with onboarding phase, inner motifs

---

## Symbolic Logic

Overlays are triggered by:

- Ritual completions
- Narrative thresholds
- Dream-based motifs
- Identity resonance nodes

They change not just the UI, but the **symbolic atmosphere** of the system.
