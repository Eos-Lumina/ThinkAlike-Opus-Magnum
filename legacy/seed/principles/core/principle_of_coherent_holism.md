# The Principle of Coherent Holism

## 1. The Core Mandate: A Fight Against Fragmentation

The central philosophical and technical struggle of the ThinkAlike project is the fight against fragmentation. We actively design against and fight technologies and methodologies that fragment ideas, lose context, or ignore the holistic vision.

**The integrity of the Holistic Vision and the health of the `Commons` are prioritized above the optimization of any individual `Locus`.**

## 2. Our Mental Model: Vision, Commons, and Locus

To put this principle into practice, we use a three-part mental model:

-   **The Holistic Vision:** The intangible "Why" of the project. It is our guiding philosophy, our core narrative, and our architectural intent. It is the soul of the `Commons`.
-   **The `Commons`:** The tangible, shared ecosystem. It is the entire project codebase, the complete documentation, and the living user experience. It is the body that must manifest the soul.
-   **The `Locus`:** Any individual part of the ecosystemâ€”a file, a function, a UI component, a document.

The purpose of a `Locus` is to serve and strengthen the `Commons`. The purpose of the `Commons` is to accurately and powerfully embody the `Holistic Vision`.

## 3. The Rejection of Context-less Work (`#FF4136`)

We explicitly reject any work, whether by human or AI agent, that is performed without sufficient context. An agent that generates a plan based on an incomplete picture of the project is actively causing harm by introducing fragmentation. A contributor who builds a feature without understanding the `Holistic Vision` it serves is weakening the `Commons`.

**Fragmentation is our highest-level failure state.**

## 4. The Practice of Holism

Every contributor and agent must adhere to the following practices:

-   **Orient Before Acting:** Always begin by understanding both the **Holistic Vision** (from the Constitution and core concepts) and the existing `Commons` (from the `source_of_truth.md` and architectural documents).
-   **Build Bridges, Not Islands:** Every new `Locus` must be created with clear connections to the `Commons`, and it must be justified by its alignment with the `Holistic Vision`.
-   **Justify with Coherence:** The first question asked of any new proposal will be: "How does this strengthen the coherence of the `Commons` and advance our `Holistic Vision`?"
