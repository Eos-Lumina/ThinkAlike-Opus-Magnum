# Proposal Migration Pathways

**Status:** Ritual Pipeline Specification
**Location:** `/docs/seed/integration/proposal_migration_pathways.md`

## Purpose

Defines how proposals — ideas born in one realm — migrate across symbolic, technical, or governance spaces, evolving and adapting through ritual and resonance.

## Migration Flow

1. **Birth** — Proposed in symbolic context (e.g. Hive, Onboarding)
2. **Ritual Invocation** — Aligned with a value constellation
3. **Bridge Mapping** — Converted into semantically interoperable form
4. **Agent Review** — Validated for coherence + continuity
5. **Landing** — Materialized in another realm (e.g., Governance, Chrona)

## Metadata Carried

- Origin ritual + initiator
- Symbolic intent + archetype alignment
- Resonance traces + feedback logs
