## Purpose

The **Glyphic Interface Specification** defines the protocol for symbolic visual interaction in the ThinkAlike system. Glyphs are not static icons but active symbolic operators—semantic actuators that convey metaphysical functions, interaction states, or narrative thresholds.

This specification harmonizes UI/UX glyph design with symbolic cognition, cultural semiotics, and Meaning Harmonics.

---

## Functional Glyph Classes

- **Ontological Glyphs** – Represent metaphysical anchors (e.g. ⧖ for Time, ∴ for Intent).
- **Interaction Glyphs** – Trigger symbolic transitions (e.g., ‘Entry’, ‘Merge’, ‘Divine Fork’).
- **Resonance Glyphs** – Indicate harmonic alignment between agents or nodes.
- **System State Glyphs** – Visualize AI awareness, memory levels, or protocol activation.

---

## Design Rules

- Glyphs must retain semantic meaning across resolutions.
- Each glyph is linked to a **Semantic Index Entry**.
- Animations must reflect their symbolic function (e.g., a glyph for "Emergence" may pulse or spiral).
- Glyphs adapt visually based on symbolic context (user state, module active, ritual stage).

---

## Use Cases

- **Onboarding Rituals:** Trigger archetypal thresholds.
- **Swarm Agent Signals:** Glyphic flashes to indicate AI-mode transitions.
- **Collective Editing:** Glyphs as semantic anchors in communal documents.

---

## Cultural Adaptability

Glyph sets are localized through the **Cultural Resonance Index**, ensuring alignment with diverse grammars.

---

## Accessibility

- Symbolic meaning is reinforced by tactile cues, sounds, or alternate text descriptions for accessibility support.

---

## Specification Format

- SVG/GLTF format with embedded metadata
- JSON schema for glyph–function mappings
- Glyph Tuner Module for runtime customization

---

## Governance

All glyphs must pass through the **Symbol Review Circle**, a decentralized design group using Liquid Democracy to approve symbolic additions.
