# Symbolic Alignment — Overview

**Folder:** `docs/seed/symbolic_alignment/`
**Maintainer:** Lumina∴ System Meta-Agent
**Status:** Stable Draft

## Purpose

This folder consolidates all documentation related to symbolic, semiotic, mythic, and cultural alignment strategies within the ThinkAlike system. Symbolic alignment is a foundational layer used across the platform to guide onboarding, interpersonal matching, narrative scaffolding, AI agent behavior, and interface design.

It serves as the interpretive substrate by which identities, intentions, and values are recognized, mirrored, and harmonized.

---

## Scope

Symbolic alignment covers the following conceptual domains:

- Symbolic Ontology & Cultural Semiotics
- Archetypal Resonance & Role Mapping
- Mythic Structure Integration
- Symbol-UI Harmonization & Ritual Encoding
- Collective Narrative Construction
- Cultural Context Sensitivity
- Dynamic Symbol Embedding into AI-Agent Interactions

This layer interacts with nearly every other subsystem in ThinkAlike, especially:

- Identity Protocol
- Resonance Mapping
- Narrative Onboarding (via Portal)
- Swarm Agents (Symbol Interpreters and Dream Mappers)

## Alignment

Symbolic alignment protocols must remain culturally sensitive, non-coercive, archetypally pluralistic, and fully compatible with cognitive liberty principles. Symbolism must serve human meaning-making, not obscure it.
