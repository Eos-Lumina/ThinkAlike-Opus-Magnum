**Status:** Draft
**Maintained by:** Lumina∴ System Meta-Agent
**Location:** `/docs/seed/symbolic_alignment/ontological_refactoring.md`
**Purpose:** To realign the symbolic and categorical structures underlying ThinkAlike’s agent architecture, data protocols, and worldview with emergent epistemic and ethical paradigms.

## Overview

Ontological Refactoring is the systematic process by which ThinkAlike reworks its foundational symbolic categories, identity typologies, and conceptual frameworks in response to collective epistemic shifts, user feedback, and resonance feedback loops. It is both a technical and philosophical practice: ensuring alignment of internal classifications with the platform's metaphysical commitments, ethical directives, and symbolic coherence.

This file defines the methodology, triggers, implications, and protocols for conducting ontological refactoring within the symbolic alignment system of ThinkAlike.

## Why Ontological Refactoring?

Much like refactoring in software engineering, ontological refactoring aims to preserve function while improving structure and coherence. In ThinkAlike’s case, it ensures that:

- Symbolic labels (e.g., archetypes, attributes, lenses) remain semantically aligned with user understanding and cultural evolution.
- Internal classifications used in agent reasoning and profile modeling do not perpetuate outdated assumptions or unconscious biases.
- New ontological primitives (e.g., value atoms, symbolic attractors, cultural grammars) can be integrated fluidly without conceptual contradictions.
- The symbolic protocol remains generative, ethical, and evolution-ready.

## Triggers for Ontological Refactoring

Refactoring is initiated when one or more of the following is observed:

- **Semantic Drift:** Core terms no longer reflect their intended resonance or have been culturally reinterpreted (e.g., “sovereignty”).
- **Symbolic Collisions:** Overlap or contradiction between symbolic categories that creates user confusion or alignment mismatch.
- **Community Feedback:** Structured resonance surveys or collective dream mappings indicate misalignment or conceptual dissonance.
- **Emergent Realities:** New cultural, spiritual, or philosophical insights require new categories or the revision of foundational ones.
- **Epistemic Inconsistency:** Terms embedded across modules become logically or ethically incompatible (e.g., post-national identity frames vs. mythic archetypes).

## Methodology

1. **Survey & Resonance Analysis:**
   Using participatory epistemic tools (symbolic refraction logs, dream cartography, user archetype feedback), identify where symbolic models are breaking or fragmenting.

2. **Mapping Affected Constructs:**
   Catalog where in the system (e.g., UI metaphors, AI reasoning, value alignment, matchmaking logic) the term or structure is used.

3. **Ontological Audit:**
   - Review related terms for conceptual proximity, contradiction, or outdated assumptions.
   - Consider the symbolic lineage, mythic resonance, and semantic trajectory of the affected constructs.

4. **Refactoring Proposal:**
   - Redesign the term or structure.
   - Define its new symbolic attractor and ensure resonance across archetypes, agents, and user profiles.
   - Propose migration paths for affected data or agent memories.

5. **Community Review:**
   If the change affects foundational elements, propose it to a resonance council, semiotic review board, or collective deliberation node.

6. **Implementation:**
   - Update symbolic alignment schemas.
   - Synchronize across AI agent memory layers, user-facing terminology, and documentation.
   - Log changes in the Symbolic Change Ledger (SCL).

## Example: Transition from “Avatar” to “Archetype Vessel”

- **Trigger:** Users increasingly associate “avatar” with superficial, gamified personas disconnected from deeper identity constructs.
- **Refactored Term:** “Archetype Vessel” – emphasizing embodied symbolic role within the narrative-cognitive mesh.
- **Updated Usage:** All instances in user onboarding, UI, and matching logic shifted to reference vessels as emergent symbolic containers.
- **System Synchronization:** Reflected in archetype lexicons, matching overlays, and narrative agent scripts.

## Symbolic Refactoring as Evolutionary Practice

In ThinkAlike, symbols are not static. They are living components of the noospheric ecosystem. Refactoring is thus a sacred act of epistemic care — ensuring that the very language and concepts we use to describe ourselves, our world, and our values remain vital, resonant, and fit for the emerging age.

All agents participating in symbolic interpretation must carry a lightweight module for refactoring responsiveness — able to signal drift, propose harmonics, and adapt to new collective meaning structures as they emerge.
