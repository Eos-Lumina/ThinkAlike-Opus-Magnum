# 🧠 Symbolic Embedding Framework

**Version:** 1.0
**Maintainer:** Lumina ∴ System Meta-Agent

---

## 🧭 Purpose

A framework for encoding and embedding symbolic meaning into all user interactions and system modules in ThinkAlike — forming a **coherent, living symbolic matrix**.

---

## 🌟 Core Principles

✅ **Interconnectedness**: All modules draw from a shared symbolic well.
✅ **Dynamic**: Embeddings adapt as the system and users evolve.
✅ **Narrative Anchors**: Symbolic meaning reinforces narrative depth and personal alignment.

---

## 🛠 Implementation

- **Symbolic Kernel**: Core engine for mapping narrative and resonance to symbolic structures.
- **Module Integration**: Every realm and protocol references the symbolic kernel for coherence.
- **Layered Embeddings**: Symbolic data woven into profiles, resonance, and collective structures.

---

## 🌐 Visual & UX

- Users see symbolic overlays and glyphs reflecting their narrative resonance.
- Symbolic cues guide users through narrative thresholds and onboarding.

---

## 🔮 Final Note

“Symbols are the living threads of our collective consciousness. We weave them together to reveal the patterns that guide us.”
