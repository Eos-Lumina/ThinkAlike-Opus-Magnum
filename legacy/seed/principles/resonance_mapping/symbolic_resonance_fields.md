# Symbolic Resonance Fields

**Status:** Active Design Layer
**Location:** `/docs/seed/resonance_mapping/symbolic_resonance_fields.md`

## Purpose

Symbolic Resonance Fields represent the layered, multidimensional semantic space in which matching between user profiles occurs. These fields organize archetypes, gestures, values, and metaphors into spatially responsive overlays, enabling rich narrative and epistemic alignment.

## Structure

Each user emits symbolic signals across several axes:

- üåÄ **Mythic Field** ‚Äî Archetypes, narrative roles, and dreams
- üß¨ **Value Field** ‚Äî Ethical orientations, needs, virtues
- üé≠ **Aesthetic Field** ‚Äî Preferences for beauty, style, form
- üó£ **Linguistic Field** ‚Äî Expression patterns, tone, symbolism
- ‚è≥ **Temporal Field** ‚Äî Pace, rhythm, life phase, urgency

## Function

Matching happens not by keywords, but by resonance within these symbolic attractor zones. A match is a moment of mutual symbolic amplification.

## 4. Visualization & User Experience

While users don't directly manipulate these "fields" as abstract categories, the effects of these fields are visualized and experienced throughout ThinkAlike:

- **User Node Appearance (Resonance Network):** The overall visual "aura" or subtle symbolic cues of a User Node might be influenced by the dominant energies in their Resonance Fields (e.g., a strong "Aesthetic Field" might result in a more artfully detailed default sigil, or a particular color hue in their waveform).
- **Resonance Priming (Resonance Network):** The highlighting of pathways and the perceived "brightness" of potential connections in the Resonance Network are based on the holistic IRS, which in turn sums up resonances across all these fields. Users are guided by the aggregate effect of these fields.
- **Abstract Clues (Portal Realm - Whispering Gallery):** When Eos Lumina‚à¥ describes a potential match anonymously, the clues provided (e.g., blurred visuals, AI-reworked voice snippets, thematic hints) are drawn from the relevant symbolic signals within the target user's various Resonance Fields (e.g., voice snippets from their Linguistic Field, visual themes from their Aesthetic or Mythic Field).
- **Color and Glyph Overlays (Conceptual Future Visualizations):** Advanced visualizations within the Resonance Network or a user's private "Epistemic Garden" (see `epistemic_garden.md`) might use color gradients, distinct glyphs, or animated overlays to represent the strength and interplay of these different fields for a user or between users who are deeply connected. For instance, a connection line on the map might shimmer with colors representing the primary fields through which two users most strongly resonate.
- **Narrative Duet Feedback:** The success or nature of a Narrative Duet provides implicit feedback to the users about their alignment (or lack thereof) across these underlying fields, as facilitated by Eos Lumina's concluding remarks.

The aim is to make the complex, multi-layered nature of resonance feel intuitive and symbolically rich, rather than exposing users to raw data from these conceptual fields directly.

## 5. Integration with Core System Components

The Symbolic Resonance Fields are deeply integrated with and inform several core components of ThinkAlike:

- **UserValueProfile / Resonance Fingerprint:** These documents describe the data structures that capture and store the symbolic signals pertaining to each field for a user. The fields are the conceptual categories for organizing the elements of a Resonance Fingerprint.
- **identity_resonance_score.md (IRS):** The IRS algorithm explicitly draws upon data from each of these fields, applying different weights and comparison logic to assess overall compatibility. Each field contributes specific dimensions to the IRS calculation.
- **protocols/narrative_duet_protocol.md:** The design of Narrative Duet scenarios and the AI Clone's response logic are informed by the need to test and explore alignment across these various fields (e.g., a Duet might have a sequence testing Value Field alignment, followed by one exploring Mythic Field compatibility).
- **narrative_match_archetypes.md & epistemic_match_modes.md:** These define specific elements primarily residing within the "Mythic Field" and contributing to the "Value Field" or "Linguistic Field" respectively.
- **realms/portal/portal_specification.md:** The Portal journey is where the user's emissions into these fields are first elicited and their Resonance Fingerprint begins to take shape.
- **realms/resonance_network/resonance_network_specification.md:** The Resonance Network is where users experience the effects of these fields through visible pathways, node characteristics, and the outcomes of their interactions.

Each Symbolic Resonance Field acts as a lens through which user compatibility can be viewed, and their combined effect generates the rich tapestry of potential connections within ThinkAlike. The system aims to find harmony not just in one field, but across the symphony of them all.

## 6. Evolution & Future Considerations

The precise definition and weighting of these fields within the IRS may evolve as the "Social LLM" learns more about what constitutes lasting, meaningful resonance.

New fields might be identified or existing ones refined as the community grows and deeper patterns of interaction emerge.

Future tools might allow users (with full consent and for reflective purposes only) to visualize the dominant energies within their own Resonance Fields via their "Epistemic Garden" or a similar interface.
