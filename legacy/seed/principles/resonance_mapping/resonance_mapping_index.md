# Resonance Mapping Index

**Status:** Folder Readme
**Location:** `/docs/seed/resonance_mapping/resonance_mapping_index.md`

---

## Purpose

This index summarizes all core documents that define the symbolic and technical architecture of value-based matching in ThinkAlike.

## Included Files

- [`resonance_mapping_readme.md`](./resonance_mapping_readme.md): Meta-layer and documentation of the overall resonance mapping schema and methodology.
- [`resonance_mapping_overview.md`](./resonance_mapping_overview.md): High-level overview of resonance mapping, its symbolic/cognitive infrastructure, and its role in the platform.
- [`identity_resonance_score.md`](./identity_resonance_score.md): Defines the IRS metric for quantifying harmonic compatibility between users, including all symbolic, narrative, and cognitive dimensions.
- [`harmonic_alignment_index.md`](./harmonic_alignment_index.md): Macro-level indicator for group/collective resonance and alignment potential.
- [`semantic_alignment_protocol.md`](./semantic_alignment_protocol.md): Protocol for mapping and bridging meaning across diverse epistemologies, lexicons, and symbolic grammars.
- [`symbolic_resonance_fields.md`](./symbolic_resonance_fields.md): Describes the multidimensional fields (mythic, value, aesthetic, linguistic, temporal) in which resonance is mapped and visualized.
- [`epistemic_match_modes.md`](./epistemic_match_modes.md): Defines epistemic alignment dimensions and their role in matching and resonance.
- [`narrative_match_archetypes.md`](./narrative_match_archetypes.md): Catalogs narrative archetypes and their use in resonance logic and matching.
- [`resonance_fingerprint.md`](./resonance_fingerprint.md): Protocol for generating and updating a user's symbolic-semiotic identity profile.
- [`epistemic_garden.md`](./epistemic_garden.md): Visualization and protocol for representing a user's belief system and philosophical evolution.

## Integration

This folder supports:

- Module 2 (Resonance Network)
- Agent matching logic
- UI reveal systems
- Identity and symbolic overlays

**Harmonization Note:** All documents in this section underwent a harmonization pass in Q2 2025, aligning with PET/Clarity, Ritual over Interface, symbolic depth, and the Alchemical Interface Initiative.

*Last updated: June 9, 2025 â€” All files harmonized and descriptions verified for PET/Clarity, symbolic, and ritual alignment.*
