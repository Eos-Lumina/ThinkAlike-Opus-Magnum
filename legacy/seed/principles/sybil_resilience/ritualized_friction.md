# Ritualized Friction

**Status:** Symbolic Anti-Sybil Mechanism
**Location:** `/docs/seed/sybil_resilience/ritualized_friction.md`

## Overview

Rather than CAPTCHAs or KYC systems, ThinkAlike introduces time-based, symbolic challenges as gentle friction points to dissuade Sybil actors.

## Techniques

- Forkable identity rituals (only humans can intuitively pass)
- Dream journaling / symbolic reflection required to unlock functions
- Onboarding metaphors that require symbolic interpretation

## Logic

These rituals cannot be easily botted or mechanized, yet remain inclusive and ethical for real humans.

Each friction point is:

- Non-invasive
- Accessible
- Meaningful in context
