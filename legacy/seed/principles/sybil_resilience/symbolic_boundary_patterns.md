# Symbolic Boundary Patterns

**Status:** Access Threshold Protocol
**Location:** `/docs/seed/sybil_resilience/symbolic_boundary_patterns.md`

## Purpose

Traditional systems use passwords or permissions.
ThinkAlike uses **symbolic boundary patterns** — rituals and resonance checks that form semi-permeable access layers.

## Pattern Types

- **Mirror Gate** — Entry only after symbolic self-reflection
- **Flame Walk** — Proposal submission only after coherence test
- **Circle Threshold** — Initiation into co-creation groups via resonance loop
- **Entropy Echo** — Matching narratives with latent ambiguity layers

These are not gamified puzzles.
They are **ritualized coherence tests** to resist shallow or scripted infiltration.

## Implementation

Used in:

- Onboarding narrative progression
- Dream submission portals
- Hive co-creation access
- Swarm agent invocation rights
