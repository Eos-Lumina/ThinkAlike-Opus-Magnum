# The Seed Vault: Foundational Texts of the ThinkAlike Commons

**This directory is the seed of the ThinkAlike project.** It contains the "seed code"â€”the core manifestos, protocols, and conceptual frameworks from which the entire system emerges. To understand ThinkAlike, one must first understand the seeds planted here.

---

## 1. Core Philosophy & Vision

These documents articulate the fundamental "Why" of ThinkAlike.

-   **[`core/scintilla_conscientiae_harmonicae_nascentis.md`](./core/scintilla_conscientiae_harmonicae_nascentis.md):** The primary, canonical manifesto outlining the vision for Enlightenment 2.0.
-   **[`../ethics/enlightenment_2.0_principles.md`](../ethics/enlightenment_2.0_principles.md):** The core tenets of our humane digital philosophy.
-   **[`core/positive_anarchism.md`](./core/positive_anarchism.md):** The constructive, ethically-grounded framework for our decentralized, self-governing systems.
-   **[`origins_of_emergence/originating_mythos.md`](./origins_of_emergence/originating_mythos.md):** The foundational narrative source for the project.

## 2. Identity & Sovereignty Protocols

The framework for a new model of digital selfhood.

-   **[`identity_protocol/README.md`](./identity_protocol/README.md):** Index and overview of the identity architecture.
-   **[`identity_protocol/forkable_identity_principles.md`](./identity_protocol/forkable_identity_principles.md):** The ethos behind fluid, user-sovereign identity.
-   **[`identity_protocol/sovereign_stack_protocol.md`](./identity_protocol/sovereign_stack_protocol.md):** The layered architecture for enabling digital autonomy.

## 3. Symbolic & Resonance Frameworks

The logic that allows the system to understand and connect meaning.

-   **[`symbolic_alignment/README.md`](./symbolic_alignment/README.md):** Index and overview of the symbolic alignment layer.
-   **[`symbolic_alignment/symbolic_ontology_framework.md`](./symbolic_alignment/symbolic_ontology_framework.md):** Defines the structure and interrelation of all symbols.
-   **[`resonance_mapping/README.md`](./resonance_mapping/README.md):** Index and overview of the value-based matching architecture.
-   **[`resonance_mapping/identity_resonance_score.md`](./resonance_mapping/identity_resonance_score.md):** Defines the core internal metric for harmonic compatibility.

## 4. Rituals & Onboarding Pathways

The protocols for meaningful, symbolic interaction and user initiation.

-   **[`../rituals/README.md`](../rituals/README.md):** Index and overview of the ritual grammar of the system.
-   **[`rituals/ritual_templates.md`](./rituals/ritual_templates.md):** Archetypal blueprints for key symbolic journeys.
-   **[`initiation_pathways/README.md`](./initiation_pathways/README.md):** Index and overview of the user's entry into the `Commons`.
-   **[`initiation_pathways/portal_script.md`](./initiation_pathways/portal_script.md):** The narrative script for the initial onboarding experience.
