# Chrona: The Currency of Time, Value, and Being

## Philosophical Foundation (The Alchemical Gold)

This paper lays out the philosophical foundation for Chrona (⧖), ThinkAlike's native, time-based, non-extractive digital currency. Chrona is not merely a transactional token; it is a symbolic representation of sacred time, embodied value, mindful contribution, and authentic being. It is the "alchemical gold" of the ThinkAlike ecosystem, designed to foster an economy of gift, reciprocity, and shared abundance, moving beyond the extractive and scarcity-driven paradigms of capitalism.

**Core Aspirations:**
- Value and recognize diverse forms of contribution beyond traditional labor (e.g., contemplation, emotional labor, ritual participation, knowledge sharing, ecological stewardship).
- Provide a mechanism for Universal Basic Income (UBI) rooted in being and participation, not productivity alone.
- Facilitate equitable exchange within and between ThinkAlike Hives and, eventually, with aligned real-world regenerative economies.
- Serve as a tangible demonstration of post-capitalist economic principles in action.
- Create a "semiotic economy" where the flow of Chrona reflects the flow of meaning, trust, and resonance.

This work is inspired by and contributes to the larger vision of a post-capitalist economic model, drawing from concepts of participatory economics and semiotic economies.

For the concrete implementation and governance of this currency, see the [Chrona (⧖) Economic Protocol](../../../realms/governance/economy/chrona_specification.md).
