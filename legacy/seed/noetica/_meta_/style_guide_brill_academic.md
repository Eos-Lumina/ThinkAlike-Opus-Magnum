# Style Guide: Brill Academic (Harmonized)

> This is the canonical style guide for all Noetica/Corpus Magnus submissions. For onboarding, system context, and contributor workflow, see [`SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md`](../../../SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md) and [`docs/source_of_truth.md`](../../../docs/source_of_truth.md).

All Noetica/Corpus Magnus submissions must follow these standards:

## 1. Language & Clarity
- Use clear, precise, and inclusive language
- Avoid jargon unless necessary; define all technical terms
- Prioritize PET/Clarity, accessibility, and symbolic alignment

## 2. Structure
- Include an abstract, keywords, and references for all academic papers
- Use section headings, bullet points, and tables for clarity
- Provide a summary or harmonization note at the end of each document

## 3. Citation & References
- Cite sources using Brill, APA, or MLA format (choose one and be consistent)
- Include a bibliography or reference list for all cited works

## 4. Visuals & Formatting
- Use diagrams, tables, and figures where helpful
- Ensure all visuals are accessible and clearly labeled

## 5. Review & Harmonization
- Submit all new works for peer or editorial review
- Regularly review and harmonize existing documents for clarity and PET/Clarity compliance
