# Corpus Vision and Mandate

> This file defines the vision and mandate for the Noetica Corpus Magnus, the intellectual heart of ThinkAlike. For onboarding, system context, and contributor workflow, see [`SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md`](../../../SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md) and [`docs/source_of_truth.md`](../../../docs/source_of_truth.md).

The Noetica Corpus Magnus is the intellectual heart of ThinkAlike—a living, evolving collection of foundational, philosophical, ethical, and technical works. Its mandate is to:
- Advance research and dialogue on ethical AI, symbolic systems, and post-capitalist economics
- Serve as a reference and inspiration for all protocols, agents, and realms in ThinkAlike
- Foster a culture of clarity, rigor, and creative exploration
- Provide a bridge between academic research and practical, ethical system design
- Ensure all research is PET/Clarity-aligned, accessible, and symbolically resonant
- Support onboarding, education, and the ongoing evolution of the ThinkAlike ecosystem

## Vision
Noetica aims to be a beacon for ethical, interdisciplinary, and visionary research—empowering contributors to shape the future of technology, society, and consciousness. It is both a repository and an engine for new ideas, protocols, and cultural transformation.

## Mandate
- Maintain the highest standards of academic rigor and ethical review
- Encourage open, collaborative, and cross-disciplinary scholarship
- Regularly review and harmonize all corpus content for clarity and impact
- Actively integrate research findings into the living system blueprint and protocols
